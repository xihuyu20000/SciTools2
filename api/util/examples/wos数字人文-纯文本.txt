AB Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize
   pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common
   characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically
   are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic
   content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure
   the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical
   genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre
   classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and
   would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In
   addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework
   for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based
   analysis of musical signals.
   In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an
   hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three
   feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and
   pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of
   the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern
   recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole
   file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described.
   Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61% for ten musical
   genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for
   human musical genre classification.

AB We describe a hardware and software system for digitizing the shape and
   color of large fragile objects under non-laboratory conditions. Our
   system employs laser triangulation rangefinders, laser time-of-flight
   rangefinders, digital still cameras, and a suite of software for
   acquiring, aligning, merging, and viewing scanned data. As a
   demonstration of this system, we digitized 10 statues by Michelangelo,
   including the well-known figure of David, two building interiors, and
   all 1,163 extant fragments of the Forms Urbis Romae, a giant marble map
   of ancient Rome. Our largest single dataset is of the David - 2 billion
   polygons and 7,000 color images. In this paper, we discuss the
   challenges we faced in building this system, the solutions we employed,
   and the lessons we learned. We focus in particular on the unusual design
   of our laser triangulation scanner and on the algorithms and software we
   developed for handling very large scanned models.

AB Aesthetics, in the world of art and photography, refers to the
   principles of the nature and appreciation of beauty. Judging beauty and
   other aesthetic qualities of photographs is a highly subjective task.
   Hence, there is no unanimously agreed standard for measuring aesthetic
   value. In spite of the lack of firm rules, certain features in
   photographic images are believed, by many, to please humans more than
   certain others. In this paper, we treat the challenge of automatically
   inferring aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a
   machine learning problem, with a peer-rated online photo sharing Website
   as data source. We extract certain visual features based on the
   intuition that they can discriminate between aesthetically pleasing and
   displeasing images. Automated classifiers are built using support vector
   machines and classification trees. Linear regression on polynomial terms
   of the features is also applied to infer numerical aesthetics ratings.
   The work attempts to explore the relationship between emotions which
   pictures arouse in people, and their low-level content. Potential
   applications include content-based image retrieval and digital
   photography.

AB The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the
   topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community,
   especially in relation to major publishers' high profit margins.
   However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of
   these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across
   various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such
   analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science
   over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical
   sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier,
   Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis increased their share of
   the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era
   (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for
   more than 50% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social
   sciences have the highest level of concentration (70% of papers from the
   top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively
   independent (20% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in
   between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies,
   such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines
   the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and
   explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes
   with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing.

AB Natural history museums store millions of specimens of geological,
   biological, and cultural entities. Data related to these objects are in
   increasing demand for investigations of biodiversity and its
   relationship to the environment and anthropogenic disturbance. A major
   barrier to the use of these data in GIS is that collecting localities
   have typically been recorded as textual descriptions, without geographic
   coordinates. We describe a method for georeferencing locality
   descriptions that accounts for the idiosyncrasies, sources of
   uncertainty, and practical maintenance requirements encountered when
   working with natural history collections. Each locality is described as
   a circle, with a point to mark the position most closely described by
   the locality description, and a radius to describe the maximum distance
   from that point within which the locality is expected to occur. The
   calculation of the radius takes into account aspects of the precision
   and specificity of the locality description, as well as the map scale,
   datum, precision and accuracy of the sources used to determine
   coordinates. This method minimizes the subjectivity involved in the
   georeferencing process. The resulting georeferences are consistent,
   reproducible, and allow for the use of uncertainty in analyses that use
   these data.

AB A computationally implemented model of the transmission of linguistic

   model (ILM)], there is no biological evolution, natural selection, nor
   any measurement of the success of the agents at communicating (except
   for results-gathering purposes). Nevertheless, counter to intuition,
   significant evolution of linguistic behavior Is observed, From an
   initially unstructured communication system (a protolanguage), a fully
   compositional syntactic meaning-string mapping emerges. Furthermore,
   given a nonuniform: frequency distribution over a meaning space and a
   production mechanism that prefers short strings, a realistic
   distribution of string lengths and patterns of stable irregularity
   emerges, suggesting that the ILM is a good model for the evolution of
   some of the fundamental features of human language.

AB Since learning English is very popular in non-English speaking
   countries, developing modern assisted-learning tools that support
   effective English learning is a critical issue in the English-language
   education field. Learning English involves memorization and practice of
   a large number of vocabulary words and numerous grammatical structures.
   Vocabulary learning is a principal issue for English learning because
   vocabulary comprises the basic building blocks of English sentences.
   Therefore, many studies have attempted to improve the efficiency and
   performance when learning English vocabulary. With the accelerated
   growth in wireless and mobile technologies, mobile learning using mobile
   devices such as PDAs, tablet PCs, and cell phones has gradually become
   considered effective because it inherits all the advantages of
   e-learning and overcomes limitations of learning time and space that
   limit web-based learning systems. Therefore, this study presents a
   personalized mobile English vocabulary learning system based on Item
   Response Theory and learning memory cycle, which recommends appropriate
   English vocabulary for learning according to individual learner
   vocabulary ability and memory cycle. The proposed system has been
   successfully implemented on personal digital assistant (PDA) for
   personalized English vocabulary learning. The experimental results
   indicated that the proposed system could obviously promote the learning
   performances and interests of learners due to effective and flexible
   learning mode for English vocabulary learning. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We describe a computer program which is able to estimate the tempo and
   the times of musical beats in expressively performed music. The input
   data may be either digital audio or a symbolic representation of music
   such as MIDI. The data is processed off-line to detect the salient
   rhythmic events and the timing of these events is analysed to generate
   hypotheses of the tempo at various metrical levels. Based on these tempo
   hypotheses, a multiple hypothesis search finds the sequence of beat
   times which has the best fit to the rhythmic events. We show that
   estimating the perceptual salience of rhythmic events significantly
   improves the results. No prior knowledge of the tempo, meter or musical
   style is assumed; all required information is derived from the data.
   Results are presented for a range of different musical styles, including
   classical, jazz, and popular works with a variety of tempi and meters.
   The system calculates the tempo correctly in most cases, the most common
   error being a doubling or halving of the tempo. The calculation of beat
   times is also robust. When errors are made concerning the phase of the
   beat, the system recovers quickly to resume correct beat tracking,
   despite the fact that there is no high level musical knowledge encoded
   in the system.

   foreign language. The one-year study adopted a pretest and posttest
   quasi-experimental design involving 110 10th grade students in two
   English classes. The independent variable was information
   technology-integrated instruction (ITII) on two different levels -
   lecture-type ITII (comparison group) and DST (experimental group). Both
   quantitative and qualitative data were collected, including English
   achievement and critical thinking scores, questionnaire responses for
   learning motivation, as well as recordings of student and teacher
   interviews for evaluating the effectiveness of DST in learning.
   Descriptive analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), multivariate
   analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), and qualitative content analysis was
   used for evaluating the obtained data. Our findings indicate that DST
   participants performed significantly better than lecture-type ITII
   participants in terms of English achievement, critical thinking, and
   learning motivation. Interview results highlight the important
   educational value of DST, as both the instructor and students reported
   that DST increased students' understanding of course content,
   willingness to explore, and ability to think critically, factors which
   are important in preparing students for an ever-changing 21st century.

AB Music information retrieval (MIR) is an emerging research area that
   receives growing attention from both the research community and music
   industry. It addresses the problem of querying and retrieving certain
   types of music from large music data set. Classification is a
   fundamental problem in MIR. Many tasks in MIR can be naturally cast in a
   classification setting, such as genre classification, mood
   classification, artist recognition, instrument recognition, etc. Music
   annotation, a new research area in MIR that has attracted much attention
   in recent years, is also a classification problem in the general sense.
   Due to the importance of music classification in MIR research, rapid
   development of new methods, and lack of review papers on recent progress
   of the field, we provide a comprehensive review on audio-based
   classification in this paper and systematically summarize the
   state-of-the-art techniques for music classification. Specifically, we
   have stressed the difference in the features and the types of
   classifiers used for different classification tasks. This survey
   emphasizes on recent development of the techniques and discusses several
   open issues for future research.

   signals and had difficulty in processing, in real time, audio signals
   containing sounds of various instruments and in tracking beats above the
   quarter-note level. The system described here can process music with
   drums and music without drums and can recognize the hierarchical beat
   structure by using three kinds of musical knowledge: of onset times, of
   chord changes, and of drum patterns. This paper also describes several
   applications of beat tracking, such as beat-driven real-time computer

AB Previous research has shown that facial motion can carry information
   about age, gender, emotion and, at least to some extent, identity. By
   combining recent computer animation techniques with psychophysical
   methods, we show that during the computation of identity the human face
   recognition system integrates both types of information: individual
   non-rigid facial motion and individual facial form. This has important
   implications for cognitive and neural models of face perception, which
   currently emphasize a separation between the processing of invariant
   aspects (facial form) and changeable aspects (facial motion) of faces.

AB Functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed before and after six
   native English speakers completed lexical tone training as part of a
   program to learn Mandarin as a second language. Language-related areas
   including Broca's area, Wernicke's area, auditory cortex, and
   supplementary motor regions were active in all subjects before and after
   training and did not vary in average location. Across all subjects,
   improvements in performance were associated with an increase in the
   spatial extent of activation in left superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann's
   area 22, putative Wernicke's area), the emergence of activity in
   adjacent Brodmann's area 42, and the emergence of activity in right
   inferior frontal gyrus ( Brodmann's area 44), a homologue of putative
   Broca's area. These findings demonstrate a form of enrichment plasticity
   in which the early cortical effects of learning a tone-based second
   language involve both expansion of preexisting language-related areas
   and recruitment of additional cortical regions specialized for functions
   similar to the new language functions.

AB This paper aims to evaluate the aesthetic visual quality of a special
   type of visual media: digital images of paintings. Assessing the
   aesthetic visual quality of paintings can be considered a highly
   subjective task. However, to some extent, certain paintings are
   believed, by consensus, to have higher aesthetic quality than others. In
   this paper, we treat this challenge as a machine learning problem, in
   order to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings based on their
   visual content. We design a group of methods to extract features to
   represent both the global characteristics and local characteristics of a
   painting. Inspiration for these features comes from our prior knowledge
   in art and a questionnaire survey we conducted to study factors that
   affect human's judgments. We collect painting images and ask human
   subjects to score them. These paintings are then used for both training
   and testing in our experiments. Experimental results show that the
   proposed work can classify high-quality and low-quality paintings with
   performance comparable to humans. This work provides a machine learning
   scheme for the research of exploring the relationship between aesthetic
   perceptions of human and the computational visual features extracted
   from paintings.

AB This paper describes a decade of work on digital imaging for museums.
   From 1989 to 1992, the visual arts system for archiving and retrieval of
   images (VASARI) project produced a digital-imaging system that made
   color-calibrated images of up to 20000 x 20000 pixels directly from
   paintings. It used seven color-separation bands in the visible region,
   resulting in an average color error of around I DeltaE(ab)* unit. These
   images have since been used to monitor the condition of paintings,
   document paintings during conservation treatment, including predicting
   appearance after cleaning, reconstruct the original appearance of
   paintings in which pigments have faded, and assess whether paintings
   have been damaged during transportation, in estimations of the surface
   reflectance spectra and in the printing of high-quality reproductions.
   We have applied similar techniques to museum infrared and X-ray imaging.
   To manage the images produced by the VASARI system, an image-processing
   package has been developed that is tailored for very large colorimetric
   images. This package has since been used in several other projects.
   including a remote image viewer designed to provide internet access to
   high-resolution images. The paper explores these developments and gives
   details of the current generation of VASARI-derived systems. set in the
   context of the state of the art for museum imaging.

AB Sports video semantic event detection is essential for sports video
   summarization and retrieval. Extensive research efforts have been
   devoted to this area in recent years. However, the existing sports video
   event detection approaches heavily rely on either video content itself,
   which face the difficulty of high-level semantic information extraction
   from video content using computer vision and image processing
   techniques, or manually generated video ontology, which is domain
   specific and difficult to be automatically aligned with the video
   content. In this paper, we present a novel approach for sports video
   semantic event detection based on analysis and alignment of webcast text
   and broadcast video. Webcast text is a text broadcast channel for sports
   game which is co-produced with the broadcast video and is easily
   obtained from the web. We first analyze webcast text to cluster and
   detect text events in an unsupervised way using probabilistic latent
   semantic analysis (pLSA). Based on the detected text event and video
   structure analysis, we employ a conditional random field model (CRFM) to
   align text event and video event by detecting event moment and event
   boundary in the video. Incorporation of webcast text into sports video
   analysis significantly facilitates sports video semantic event
   detection. We conducted experiments on 33 hours of soccer and basketball
   games for webcast analysis, broadcast video analysis and text/video
   semantic alignment. The results are encouraging and compared with the
   manually labeled ground truth.

AB Efficient and intelligent music information retrieval is a very
   important topic of the 21st century. With the ultimate goal of building
   personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the
   problem of intelligent music information retrieval. Huron [10] points
   out that since the preeminent functions of music are social and
   psychological, the most useful characterization would be based on four
   types of information: genre, emotion, style, and similarity.
   This paper introduces Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms (DWCH)
   for music feature extraction for music information retrieval. The
   histograms are computed from the coefficients of the db(8) Daubechies
   wavelet filter applied to 3 s of music. A comparative study of sound
   features and classification algorithms on a dataset compiled by
   Tzanetakis shows that combining DWCH with timbral features (MFCC and
   FFT), with the use of multiclass extensions of support vector machine,
   achieves approximately 80% of accuracy, which is a significant
   improvement over the previously known result on this dataset. On another
   dataset the combination achieves 75% of accuracy.
   The paper also studies the issue of detecting emotion in music. Rating
   of two subjects in the three bipolar adjective pairs are used. The
   accuracy of around 70% was achieved in predicting emotional labeling in
   these adjective pairs. The paper also studies the problem of identifying
   groups of artists based on their lyrics and sound using a
   semi-supervised classification algorithm. Identification of artist
   groups based on the Similar Artist lists at All Music Guide is
   attempted. The semi-supervised learning algorithm resulted in nontrivial
   increases in the accuracy to more than 70%.
   Finally, the paper conducts a proof-of-concept experiment on similarity
   search using the feature set.

AB The increasing availability of (digital) cultural heritage artefacts
   offers great potential for increased access to art content, but also
   necessitates tools to help users deal with such abundance of
   information. User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their
   users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to
   adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he
   or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system
   to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are
   most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of
   transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based
   recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (N = 60) evaluated
   interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in
   the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users
   with artworks that are of interest to them, based on their ratings of
   other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent, version 2 explained to
   the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a
   rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of
   interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a
   recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations.
   Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency. Showing how
   certain the system was of a recommendation did not influence trust and
   acceptance. A number of guidelines for design of recommender systems in
   the cultural heritage domain have been derived from the study's results.

   painting styles. The research has the potential to provide a powerful
   tool to art historians for studying connections among artists or periods
   in the history of art. Depending on specific applications, paintings can
   be categorized in different ways. In this paper, we focus on comparing
   the painting styles. of artists. To profile the style of an artist, a
   mixture of stochastic models is estimated using training images. The
   two-dimensional (2-D) multiresolution hidden Markov model (MHMM) is used
   in the experiment. These models form an artist's distinct digital
   signature. For certain types of paintings, only strokes provide reliable
   information to distinguish artists. Chinese ink paintings are a prime
   example of the above phenomenon; they do not have colors or even tones.
   The 2-D MHMM analyzes relatively large regions in an image, which in
   turn makes it more likely to capture properties of the painting strokes.
   The mixtures of 2-D MHMMs established for artists can be further used to
   classify paintings and compare paintings or artists. We implemented and
   tested the system using high-resolution digital photographs of some of
   China's most renowned artists. Experiments have demonstrated good
   potential of our approach in automatic analysis of paintings. Our work
   can be applied to other domains.

AB Increasing our understanding of Earth's biodiversity and responsibly
   stewarding its resources are among the most crucial scientific and
   social challenges of the new millennium. These challenges require
   fundamental new knowledge of the organization, evolution, functions, and
   interactions among millions of the planet's organisms. Herein, we
   present a perspective on the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), a moonshot
   for biology that aims to sequence, catalog, and characterize the genomes
   of all of Earth's eukaryotic biodiversity over a period of 10 years. The
   outcomes of the EBP will inform a broad range of major issues facing
   humanity, such as the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the
   conservation of endangered species and ecosystems, and the preservation
   and enhancement of ecosystem services. We describe hurdles that the
   project faces, including data-sharing policies that ensure a permanent,
   freely available resource for future scientific discovery while
   respecting access and benefit sharing guidelines of the Nagoya Protocol.
   We also describe scientific and organizational challenges in executing
   such an ambitious project, and the structure proposed to achieve the
   project's goals. The far-reaching potential benefits of creating an open
   digital repository of genomic information for life on Earth can be
   realized only by a coordinated international effort.

   interpreted by the users as highlights. Instead, we search for
   highlights in those video segments that are expected to excite the users
   most. It is namely realistic to assume that a highlighting event induces
   a steady increase in a user's excitement, as compared to other, less
   interesting events. We mimic the expected variations in a user's
   excitement by observing the temporal behavior of selected audiovisual
   low-level features and the editing scheme of a video. Relations between
   this noncontent information and the evoked excitement are drawn partly
   from psychophysiological research and partly from analyzing the
   live-video directing practice. The expected variations in a user's
   excitement are represented by the excitement time curve, which is,
   subsequently, filtered in an adaptive way to extract the highlights in
   the prespecified total length and in view of the preferences regarding
   the highlights strength: extraction can namely be performed with
   variable sensitivity to capture few "strong" highlights or more "less
   strong" ones. We evaluate and discuss the performance of our method on
   the case study of soccer TV broadcasts.

AB We present a method for computer generated pen-and-ink illustrations by
   the simulation of stippling. In a stipple drawing, dots are used to
   represent tone and also material of surfaces. We create such drawings by
   generating an initial dot set which is then processed by a relaxation
   method based on Voronoi diagrams. The point patterns generated are
   approximations of Poisson disc distributions and can also be used for
   integrating functions or the positioning of objects. We provide an
   editor similar to paint systems for interactively creating stipple
   drawings. This makes it possible to create such drawings within a matter
   of hours, instead of days or even weeks when the drawing is done
   manually.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce Digital Methods
   Initiative Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset, a toolset for capturing
   and analyzing Twitter data. Instead of just presenting a technical paper
   detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data
   used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have
   epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at
   situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological
   debates in the social sciences and humanities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors review the possibilities and
   limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data
   in order to address the various ways in which computational systems
   frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and
   put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and
   epistemological plurality.
   Findings - The authors find that design decisions and more general
   methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building
   tools for computational social science or digital humanities.
   Practical implications - Besides methodological transparency, the
   software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and
   interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is
   emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by
   allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a
   variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work
   at the micro, meso, and macro levels.
   Originality/value - The paper opens up critical debate by connecting
   tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its
   repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the
   software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a
   variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and
   extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological
   approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational
   work open for various epistemic sensibilities.

   analyzing and classifying over 2,000 specimens covering a 100-year

   itself as a constitutive element of academic writing-one that provides a
   revealing insight into the structural nature of subauthorship
   collaboration in science. Complementary data on rates of coauthorship
   are also presented to highlight the growing importance of teamwork and
   the increasing division of labor in contemporary chemistry. The results
   of this study are compared with the findings of a parallel study of

AB In this paper, we present a connectionist approach to automatic
   transcription of polyphonic piano music. We first compare the
   performance of several neural network models on the task of recognizing
   tones from time-frequency representation of a musical signal. We then
   propose a new partial tracking technique, based on a combination of an
   auditory model and adaptive oscillator networks. We show how
   synchronization of adaptive oscillators can be exploited to track
   partials in a musical signal. We also present an extension of our
   technique for tracking individual partials to a method for tracking
   groups of partials by joining adaptive oscillators into networks. We
   show that oscillator networks improve the accuracy of transcription with
   neural networks. We also provide a short overview of our entire
   transcription system and present its performance on transcriptions of
   several synthesized and real piano recordings. Results show that our
   approach represents a viable alternative to existing transcription
   systems.

AB We present a wireless virtual reality system and a prototype full body
   Tai Chi training application. Our primary contribution is the creation
   of a virtual reality system that tracks the full body in a working
   volume of 4 meters by 5 meters by 2.3 meters high to produce an animated
   representation of the user with 42 degrees of freedom. This combined
   with a lightweight (< 3 pounds) belt-worn video receiver and
   head-mounted display-provides a wide area, untethered virtual
   environment that allows exploration of new application areas. Our
   secondary contribution is our attempt to show that user interface
   techniques made possible by such a system can improve training for a
   full body motor task. We tested several immersive techniques, such as
   providing multiple copies of a teacher's body positioned around the
   student and allowing the student to superimpose his body directly over
   the virtual teacher None of these techniques proved significantly better
   than mimicking traditional Tai Chi instruction, where we provided one
   virtual teacher directly in front of the student. We consider the
   implications of these findings for future motion training tasks.

AB As the World Wide Web becomes a large source of digital music, the music
   recommendation system has got a great demand. There are several music
   recommendation systems for both commercial and academic areas, which
   deal with the user preference as fixed. However, since the music
   preferred by a user may change depending on the contexts, the
   conventional systems have inherent problems. This paper proposes a
   context-aware music recommendation system (CA-MRS) that exploits the
   fuzzy system, Bayesian networks and the utility theory in order to
   recommend appropriate music with respect to the context. We have
   analyzed the recommendation process and performed a subjective test to
   show the usefulness of the proposed system.

AB Topic models are a useful and ubiquitous tool for understanding large
   corpora. However, topic models are not perfect, and for many users in
   computational social science, digital humanities, and information
   studies-who are not machine learning experts-existing models and
   frameworks are often a "take it or leave it" proposition. This paper
   presents a mechanism for giving users a voice by encoding users'
   feedback to topic models as correlations between words into a topic
   model. This framework, interactive topic modeling (itm), allows
   untrained users to encode their feedback easily and iteratively into the
   topic models. Because latency in interactive systems is crucial, we
   develop more efficient inference algorithms for tree-based topic models.
   We validate the framework both with simulated and real users.

AB Motivated by psychophysiological investigations on the human auditory
   system, a bio-inspired two-dimensional auditory representation of music
   signals is exploited, that captures the slow temporal modulations.
   Although each recording is represented by a second-order tensor (i.e., a
   matrix), a third-order tensor is needed to represent a music corpus.
   Non-negative multilinear principal component analysis (NMPCA) is
   proposed for the unsupervised dimensionality reduction of the
   third-order tensors. The NMPCA maximizes the total tensor scatter while
   preserving the non-negativity of auditory representations. An algorithm
   for NMPCA is derived by exploiting the structure of the Grassmann
   manifold. The NMPCA is compared against three multilinear subspace
   analysis techniques, namely the non-negative tensor factorization, the
   high-order singular value decomposition, and the multilinear principal
   component analysis as well as their linear counterparts, i.e., the
   non-negative matrix factorization, the singular value decomposition, and
   the principal components analysis in extracting features that are
   subsequently classified by either support vector machine or nearest
   neighbor classifiers. Three different sets of experiments conducted on
   the GTZAN and the ISMIR2004 Genre datasets demonstrate the superiority
   of NMPCA against the aforementioned subspace analysis techniques in
   extracting more discriminating features, especially when the training
   set has small cardinality. The best classification accuracies reported
   in the paper exceed those obtained by the state-of-the-art music genre
   classification algorithms applied to both datasets.

PD JUN 2009

AB The creative industries have frequently expressed concern that they
   can't compete with freely available copies of their content. Competing
   with free is particularly concerning for movie studios, whose content
   may be more prone to single use consumption than other industries such
   as music. This issue has gained renewed importance recently with the
   advent of new digital video recording and distribution technologies, and
   the widespread availability of Internet piracy.
   We examine competition between "free" and paid video content in two
   important contexts., the impact of legitimate free distribution in one
   channel on sales through paid channels, and the impact of illegitimate
   free distribution in pirated channels on sales through paid channels. We
   do this by studying the impact of movie broadcasts on D VD demand and
   the impact of piracy availability at the time of broadcast on DVD
   demand. Our data include all movies shown on over-the-air and cable
   television during an eight-month period in 2005-2006.
   With respect to the impact of movie broadcasts on piracy and sales, we
   find that movie broadcasts on over-the-air networks result in a
   significant increase in both D VD sales at Amazon. coin and illegal
   downloads for those movies that are available on BitTorrent at the time
   of broadcast. With respect to the impact of piracy on sales, we use the
   television broadcast as an exogenous demand shock and find that the
   availability of pirated content at the time of broadcast has no effect
   on post-broadcast D VD sales gains.
   Together our results suggest that creative artists can use product
   differentiation and market segmentation strategies to compete with
   freely available copies of their content. Specifically, the
   post-broadcast increase in DVD sales suggests that giving away content
   in one channel can stimulate sales in a paid channel if the free content
   is sufficiently differentiated from its paid counterpart. Likewise, our
   finding that the presence of pirated content does not cannibalize sales
   for the movies in our sample suggests that if free and paid products
   appeal to separate customer segments, the presence of free products need
   not harm paid sales.

AB Three-dimensional digital modeling of Heritage works of art through
   optical scanners, has been demonstrated in recent years with results of
   exceptional interest. However, the routine application of
   three-dimensional (3-D) modeling to Heritage conservation still requires
   the systematic investigation of a number of technical problems.
   In this paper, the acquisition process of the 3-D digital model of the
   Maddalena by Donatello, a wooden statue representing one of the major
   masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance which was swept away by the
   Florence flood of 1966 and successively restored, is described.
   The paper reports all the steps of the acquisition procedure, from the
   project planning to the solution of the various problems due to range
   camera calibration and to material non optically cooperative.
   Since the scientific focus is centered on the 3-D model overall
   dimensional accuracy, a methodology for its quality control is
   described. Such control has demonstrated how, in some situations, the
   ICP-based alignment can lead to incorrect results. To circumvent this
   difficulty we propose an alignment technique based on the fusion of ICP
   with close-range digital photogrammetry and a noninvasive procedure in
   order to generate a final accurate model. In the end detailed results
   are presented, demonstrating the improvement of the final model, and how
   the proposed sensor fusion ensure a pre-specified level of accuracy.

AB Hirsch's h index is becoming the standard measure of an individual's
   research accomplishments. The aggregation of individuals' measures is
   also the basis for global measures at institutional or national levels.
   To investigate whether the h index can be reliably computed through
   alternative sources of citation records, the Web of Science (WoS),
   PsycINFO and Google Scholar (GS) were used to collect citation records
   for known publications of four Spanish psychologists. Compared with WoS,
   PsycINFO included a larger percentage of publication records, whereas GS
   outperformed WoS and PsycINFO in this respect. Compared with WoS,
   PsycINFO retrieved a larger number of citations in unique areas of
   psychology, but it retrieved a smaller number of citations in areas that
   are close to statistics or the neurosciences, whereas GS retrieved the
   largest numbers of citations in all cases. Incorrect citations were
   scarce in Wos (0.3%), more prevalent in PsycINFO (1.1%), and
   overwhelming in GS (16.5%). All platforms retrieved unique citations,
   the largest set coming from GS. WoS and PsycINFO cover distinct areas of
   psychology unevenly, thus applying different penalties on the h index of
   researches working in different fields. Obtaining fair and accurate h
   indices required the union of citations retrieved by all three
   platforms.

AB The Measuring and Observation Tool in Sports (MOTS) has been designed to
   facilitate the systematic observation of sports. It is a user-friendly
   tool developed to help researchers observe, codify, register, and
   analyze any situation that occurs in a natural or habitual context in
   which behaviors are spontaneous. Users can define up to 12 mutually
   exclusive code sets and up to 120 different behaviors to facilitate data
   collection and can work with any observational data type: event
   sequences, event sequences over time, state sequences, interval
   sequences, or multievent sequences. MOTS plays digital video files,
   which allows for video and taxonomic tools to be displayed on the screen
   at the same time. The observations are registered automatically,
   including the time and duration of the event, in frames and seconds
   simultaneously. Furthermore, the data analysis feature allows the user
   to calculate the percentage of intervals, the frequency distributions,
   and the conditional probabilities.

AB In this paper, we present a graphical model for polyphonic music
   transcription. Our model, formulated as a dynamical Bayesian network,
   embodies a transparent and computationally tractable approach to this
   acoustic analysis problem. An advantage of our approach is that it
   places emphasis on explicitly modeling the sound generation procedure.
   It provides a clear framework in which both high level (cognitive) prior
   information on music structure can be coupled with low level (acoustic
   physical) information in a principled manner to perform the analysis.
   The model is a special case of the, generally intractable, switching
   Kalman filter model. Where possible, we derive, exact polynomial time
   inference procedures, and otherwise efficient approximations. We argue
   that our generative model based approach is computationally feasible for
   many music applications and is readily extensible to more general
   auditory scene analysis scenarios.

AB This paper presents Kizamu, a computer-based sculpting system for
   creating digital characters for the entertainment industry. Kizamu
   incorporates a blend of new algorithms, significant technical advances,
   and novel user interaction paradigms into a system that is both powerful
   and unique.
   To meet the demands of high-end digital character design, Kizamu
   addresses three requirements posed to us by a major production studio.
   First, animators and artists want digital clay - a medium with the
   characteristics of real clay and the advantages of being digital.
   Second, the system should run on standard hardware at interactive rates.
   Finally, the system must accept and generate standard 3D representations
   thereby enabling integration into an existing animation production
   pipeline.
   At the heart of the Kizamu system are Adaptively Sampled Distance Fields
   (ADFs), a volumetric shape representation with the characteristics
   required for digital clay. In this paper, we describe the system and
   present the major research advances in ADFs that were required to make
   Kizamu a reality.

   traces how the rise of digital culture has led to the reconsideration of

   spearheaded by an array of fields from writing programs to computer
   science. Drawing upon case studies from new media education and the
   digital humanities, the paper argues that design thinking that is
   situated, interpretive, and user-oriented is well suited to these

AB In 2005, Franco Moretti introduced Distant Reading to analyse entire
   literary text collections. This was a rather revolutionary idea compared
   to the traditional Close Reading, which focuses on the thorough
   interpretation of an individual work. Both reading techniques are the
   prior means of Visual Text Analysis. We present an overview of the
   research conducted since 2005 on supporting text analysis tasks with
   close and distant reading visualizations in the digital humanities.
   Therefore, we classify the observed papers according to a taxonomy of
   text analysis tasks, categorize applied close and distant reading
   techniques to support the investigation of these tasks and illustrate
   approaches that combine both reading techniques in order to provide a
   multi-faceted view of the textual data. In addition, we take a look at
   the used text sources and at the typical data transformation steps
   required for the proposed visualizations. Finally, we summarize
   collaboration experiences when developing visualizations for close and
   distant reading, and we give an outlook on future challenges in that
   research area.

   not carried out in an ad hoc manner, but was built on a rigorous
   methodological foundation, firstly by ensuring that the work was
   thoroughly grounded in the practice of humanities researchers (including
   'digitally-aware' humanists), and secondly by analysing these practices
   in terms of 'scholarly primitives', basic activities common to research
   across humanities disciplines. The projects were then undertaken to
   provide systems and services that support various of these primitives,
   with a view to developing a research infrastructure constructed from
   these components, which may be regarded as a 'production line' for
   humanities research, supporting research activities from the creation of
   primary sources in digital form through to the publication of research
   outputs for discussion and re-use. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   has garnered a great deal of attention and interest (Bulger et al., ;
   Freiman et al., ; Trace & Karadkar, ; University of Minnesota Libraries,
   ; Wilson & Patrick, ). Research libraries and archives, as well as
   groups from within the humanities disciplines themselves, are being
   tasked with providing robust support for information management
   practices, including helping to engage humanities scholars with
   appropriate digital technologies in ways that are sensitive to
   disciplinary-based cultures and practices. However, infrastructure
   (services, tools, and collaborative networks) to support scholarly
   information significant barriers impede this work, primarily because the
   management is still under development. Under the aegis of the Scholars
   Tracking Archival Resources (STAR) project we are studying how
   humanities scholars gather and manage primary source materials with a
   goal of developing software to support their information management
   practices. This article reports the findings from our interviews with 26
   humanities scholars, in conjunction with a set of initial requirements
   for a mobile application that will support scholars in capturing
   documents, recreating the archival context, and uploading these
   documents to cloud storage for access and sharing from other devices.

AB In this paper we compare two academic networking platforms, HASTAC and
   Hypotheses, to show the distinct ways in which they serve specific
   communities in the Digital Humanities (DH) in different national and
   disciplinary contexts. After providing background information on both
   platforms, we apply co-word analysis and topic modeling to show thematic
   similarities and differences between the two sites, focusing
   particularly on how they frame DH as a new paradigm in humanities
   research. We encounter a much higher ratio of posts using
   humanities-related terms compared to their digital counterparts,
   suggesting a one-way dependency of digital humanities-related terms on
   the corresponding unprefixed labels. The results also show that the
   terms digital archive, digital literacy, and digital pedagogy are
   relatively independent from the respective unprefixed terms, and that
   digital publishing, digital libraries, and digital media show
   considerable cross-pollination between the specialization and the
   general noun. The topic modeling reproduces these findings and reveals
   further differences between the two platforms. Our findings also
   indicate local differences in how the emerging field of DH is
   conceptualized and show dynamic topical shifts inside these respective
   contexts.

AB New types of digital data, tools, and methods, for instance those that
   cross academic disciplines and domains, those that feature teams instead
   of single scholars, and those that involve individuals from outside the
   academy, enables new forms of scholarship and teaching in digital
   humanities. Such scholarship promotes reuse of digital data, provokes
   new research questions, and cultivates new audiences. Digital curation,
   the process of managing a trusted body of information for current and
   future use, helps maximize the value of research in digital humanities.
   Predicated on semistructured interviews, this naturalistic case study
   explores the creation, use, storage, and planned reuse of data by 45
   interviewees involved with 19 Office of Digital Humanities Start-Up
   Grant (SUG) projects. Interviewees grappled with challenges surrounding
   data, collaboration and communication, planning and project management,
   awareness and outreach, resources, and technology. Overall this study
   explores the existing digital curation practices and needs of scholars
   engaged in innovative digital humanities work and to discern how closely
   these practices and needs align with the digital curation literature.

AB The omnipresence and escalating efficiency of digital, networked
   information systems alongside the resulting deluge of digital corpora,
   apps, software, and data has coincided with increased concerns in the
   humanities with new topics and methods of inquiry. In particular,
   digital humanities (DH), the subfield that has emerged as the site of
   most of this work, has received growing attention in higher education in
   recent years. This study seeks to facilitate a better understanding of
   digital humanities by studying the motivations and practices of digital
   humanists as information workers in the humanities. To this end, we
   observe information work through interviews with DH scholars about their
   work practices and through a survey of DH programs such as graduate
   degrees, certificates, minors, and training institutes. In this study we
   focus on how the goals behind methodology (a link between theories and
   method) surface in everyday DH work practices and in DH curricula in
   order to investigate if the critiques that have appeared in relation to
   DH information work are well founded and to suggest alternative
   narratives about information work in DH that will help advance the
   impact of the field in the humanities and beyond.

AB Digitally-aided reviews of large bodies of text-based information, such
   as academic literature, are growing in capability but are not yet common
   in environmental fields. Environmental sciences and studies can benefit
   from application of digital tools to create comprehensive, replicable,
   interdisciplinary reviews that provide rapid, up-to-date, and
   policy-relevant reports of existing work. This work reviews the
   potential for applications of computational text mining and analysis
   tools originating in the humanities to environmental science and policy
   questions. Two process-oriented case studies of digitally-aided
   environmental literature reviews and meta-analyses illustrate potential
   benefits and limitations. Amedium-sized, medium-resolution review
   (similar to 8000 journal abstracts and titles) focuses on topic modeling
   as a rapid way to identify thematic changes over time. Asmall,
   high-resolution review (similar to 300 full text journal articles)
   combines collocation and network analysis with manual coding to
   synthesize and question empirical field work. We note that even small
   digitally-aided analyses are close to the upper limit of what can be
   done manually. Established computational methods developed in humanities
   disciplines and refined by humanities and social science scholars to
   interrogate large bodies of textual data are applicable and useful in
   environmental sciences but have not yet been widely applied. Two case
   studies provide evidence that digital tools can enhance insight. Two
   major conclusions emerge. First, digital tools enable scholars to engage
   large literatures rapidly and, in some cases, more comprehensively than
   is possible manually. Digital tools can confirm manually identified
   patterns or identify additional patterns visible only at a large scale.
   Second, digital tools allow for more replicable and transparent
   conclusions to be drawn from literature reviews and meta-analyses. The
   methodological subfields of digital humanities and computational social
   sciences will likely continue to create innovative tools for analyzing
   large bodies of text, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary
   collaboration with the environmental fields.

AB The successful deployment of digital technologies by humanities scholars
   presents computer scientists with a number of unique scientific and
   technological challenges. The task seems particularly daunting because
   issues in the humanities are presented in abstract language demanding
   the kind of subtle interpretation often thought to be beyond the scope
   of artificial intelligence, and humanities scholars themselves often
   disagree about the structure of their disciplines. The future of
   humanities computing depends on having tools for automatically
   discovering complex semantic relationships among different parts of a
   corpus. Digital library tools for the humanities will need to be capable
   of dynamically tracking the introduction of new ideas and
   interpretations and applying them to older texts in ways that support
   the needs of scholars and students.
   This paper describes the design of new algorithms and the adjustment of
   existing algorithms to support the automated and semi-automated
   management of domain-rich metadata for an established digital humanities
   project, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Our approach starts
   with a "hand-built" formal ontology that is modified and extended by a
   combination of automated and semi-automated methods, thus becoming a
   "dynamic ontology". We assess the suitability of current information
   retrieval and information extraction methods for the task of
   automatically maintaining the ontology. We describe a novel measure of
   term-relatedness that appears to be particularly helpful for predicting
   hierarchical relationships in the ontology. We believe that our project
   makes a further contribution to information science by being the first
   to harness the collaboration inherent in a expert-maintained dynamic
   reference work to the task of maintaining and extending a formal
   ontology. We place special emphasis on the task of bringing domain
   expertise to bear on all phases of the development and deployment of the
   system, from the initial design of the software and ontology to its
   dynamic use in a fully operational digital reference work.

AB Computing and digitisation are transforming not only the conditions of
   work for humanists, but also the ways in which humanists think and their
   disciplines are configured. The digital world both enables and compels
   new ways of thinking. And, significantly, it is just as transformative
   of teaching as it is of scholarship. Indeed, the most interesting thing
   about the new digital humanities environment may be that the distinction
   between teaching and scholarship is itself being eroded. The database is
   fast becoming the principal site of work in the humanities.

AB Digital tools offer new affordances and methodologies to humanities
   scholars' research. This study used a constructivist grounded theory
   approach to examine humanities scholars' research practices, including
   their use of a wide range of resources and digital technologies. Using
   in-depth study, several themes emerged from the research relating to the
   role of technology in shaping humanities scholars' research practices.
   The themes include: (a) humanities scholars' research approaches and
   technology tools; (b) the humanities scholar as tool developer; (c) the
   role of data preparation as a meta-level research practice; (d) data
   visualization versus numeric outputs-one size does not fit all; (e) the
   importance of flexibility and agency; (f) technology tools in support of
   the researcher as writer; and (g) working alone/working
   together-technology tools and collaborative practice. The heterogeneous
   nature of humanities scholars' research practices are explored and the
   resulting implications for digital tool design. Two new research
   practices-tool development and data preparation-are proposed. The
   diverse digital technologies humanities scholars use support the
   traditional ways of working within their discipline, as well as creating
   potential for new scholarly practices.

AB The ever growing number of textual historical collections calls for
   methods that can meaningfully connect and explore these. Different
   collections offer different perspectives, expressing views at the time
   of writing or even a subjective view of the author. We propose to
   connect heterogeneous digital collections through temporal references
   found in documents as well as their textual content. We evaluate our
   approach and find that it works very well on digital-native collections.
   Digitized collections pose interesting challenges and with improved
   preprocessing our approach performs well. We introduce a novel search
   interface to explore and analyze the connected collections that
   highlights different perspectives and requires little domain knowledge.
   In our approach, perspectives are expressed as complex queries. Our
   approach supports humanity scholars in exploring collections in a novel
   way and allows for digital collections to be more accessible by adding
   new connections and new means to access collections.

AB The paper deals with the new generation of studies in History and the
   Humanities - Digital Humanities (DH). Fruitful debates on the nature of
   digital era in the development of the Humanities are summarized. It is
   important to mark the limits of analytical possibilities of DH, to
   define the aims, and to choose the 'best practices' in the field. The
   number of publications under the 'umbrella' of DH is analyzed. The
   today's understanding of the DH field can be divided into three
   viewpoints: researchers see it as a project-oriented approach to the
   digitalization and investigation of the past and present; tutors
   underline the possibilities of DH teaching programs for students over
   the world; finally, DH became the profitable brand that gives advantages
   and administrative support to the members of academic community. "Data
   era" became a feature of contemporary discussion of digitalization of
   historical and cultural heritage for purposes of study in the
   Humanities. The trend corresponds with the "big data" research developed
   last years. Data as a research source in the Humanities changed the
   perspective of studying sources in the context of "analog" nature and
   genre. Data are essentially multimedia; therefore the analysis of data
   should be multiple. Debates on DH and definitions of DH as a
   breakthrough approach in the Humanities demonstrate the need for
   collaboration and consolidation of community. ADHO (Alliance of Digital
   Humanities Organizations) is a good example of international collective
   laboratory in DH. Journals and online-projects are also developed in DH;
   among them "Digital Humanities Quarterly" (since 2007), "Journal of
   Digital Humanities" (since 2011), "Digital Humanities Now" are to be
   mentioned.

AB Digitizing ancient books, especially those related to the humanities, is
   practiced in many countries. The number of full-text databases in the
   humanities is increasing. Studies have shown that ancient books are
   important resources for humanities scholars and researchers. However,
   comparatively little research has been done concerning the use of those
   databases. Thirty graduate students majoring in Chinese Literature or
   History were interviewed in this study. This study attempts to answer
   the following questions: How do interviewees use the databases? Do they
   encounter any problems? What do they have to say concerning ancient
   books in digital or paper form? The results show that humanities
   graduate students use ancient books databases to locate information
   concerning their research interests. Most of them are satisfied with the
   search functions and feel that the databases are convenient to use.
   However, they comment that the coverage, quality, and search interface
   could be improved upon. As well, a few graduate students suggest that
   links to related resources should be added. They state that they do not
   totally rely upon the databases and continue to use paper sources.

AB The application of research practices and methodologies from the
   Information and Communication Technologies to Humanities studies is
   having a great impact on the way humanities research is being conducted.
   However, although many applications have been developed to automatically
   analyse document collections from the historical or the literary domain,
   they often fail to provide a real support to scholars because of their
   inherent complexity: technical skills are often required to use them and
   to inspect their output. On the other hand, some systems are more
   user-friendly, but present basic analyses and are limited to the needs
   of a specific research community.
   In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations, we developed ALCIDE
   (Analysis of Language and Content In a Digital Environment), a web-based
   platform designed to assist humanities scholars in navigating and
   analysing large quantities of textual data such as historical sources
   and literary works. This suite of tools combines advanced text
   processing techniques with intuitive visualisations of the output to
   serve a broad range of research questions, which no other comparable
   tool can address in a single platform. Textual corpora can be inspected
   and compared along five semantic dimensions: who, where, when, what and
   how. Such dimensions in different combinations allow targeting many key
   questions of different humanities disciplines, as shown in the five use
   cases presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Digital Humanities Observatory was created to support the long-term
   management of electronic cultural heritage resources for the digital
   humanities in Ireland. However, the project grant was for three years
   and the economic downturn has diminished opportunities for continued
   funding. The challenge is to demonstrate the importance and value of
   maintaining these e-resources, and to make it feasible for the resource
   owners to do so without the DHO if necessary. ICT systems can support
   cost effective and value-adding access and management of resources in a
   way that might be sustained in the short-term by organizations and
   projects that lack the funding, staffing, and skills to build and
   operate a digital preservation environment. In this project paper we
   describe how the DHO uses technology to promote the value of
   preservation and interoperability of e-resources, and to provide a means
   for achieving these goals in the face of significant sustainability
   risks.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider how digital resources
   might best be created and how the digital medium might best be exploited
   to serve the needs of research and teaching in the humanities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The history of text-based humanities
   computing is traced to illustrate the complexity of humanities sources
   and the requirements for their representation in digital form.
   Findings - The paper finds that digital information is completely
   different from any other kind of information, being dynamic, extensible
   and manipulable in many different ways. It is not static and it can be
   manipulated in many different ways. The Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   has been widely adopted in the humanities particularly for full text
   sources encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative application.
   XML permits the display, analysis and manipulation of fine detail within
   a document. It also facilitates the chunking of information and the
   integration of data and metadata leading to new forms of publication
   that exploit the digital medium to the full.
   Research limitations/implications - The research environment proposed in
   this paper challenges current modes of working with a more innovative
   approach to the nature and functionality of digital representations of
   humanities sources.
   Originality/value - The paper looks at the development of humanities
   computing and should be helpful for anyone embarking on or managing a
   humanities digital project.

AB The Digital Humanities Lab is a research institute of the faculty of
   Humanities of the University of Basel. The research profile of the dhLab
   is centered around computer science, digital imaging, digital
   photography and the accessibility of digital objects in humanities
   research. The project Digital Materiality examines how new methods to
   describe the reflection of light on surfaces can be applied to art
   historical research. In the main focus are mosaics and early prints.
   Both types of artwork have a strong interaction with light.
   Unfortunately standard photographic approaches are not able to capture
   the dynamic component of the light-surface interdependence.
   The technical part of the project focuses on improving RTI (Reflectance
   Transformation Imaging) techniques. By modifying the model accordingly
   to the requirements of art historical research, the digital reproduction
   shall be able to transport the relevant attributes of the original in
   the digital domain. The improvements take into account more
   sophisticated but still robust reflection models that allow the
   realistic visualization of diffuse and specular surfaces. The
   visualization is implemented in WebGL, to allow the integration of RTI
   in an web-based environment, especially Virtual Research Environments,

AB Digital Humanities (DH) has been depicted as an innovative engine for
   humanities, as a challenge for Data Science, and as an area where
   libraries, archives and providers of e-research infrastructures join
   forces with research pioneers. However DH is defined, one thing is
   certain: DH is a new community which manifests and identifies itself via
   the Internet and social media. In this paper we propose to describe DH
   as a virtual community (VC), and discuss the implications of such an
   epistemic approach. We start with a (re) inspection of the scholarly
   discourse about VCs, and the analytic frameworks which have been applied
   to study them. We discuss the aspects that are highlighted by taking
   such a stance, and use the guidelines proposed by the FP7 European
   Network of Excellence in Internet Science (EINS) in our investigation.

AB Future, wearable, digital devices are constantly emerging and celebrated
   in the mainstream news media. We are gradually embracing the idea that
   our future digital life will involve watch computers, heads-up displays,
   brain-computer interfaces, body sensors, and digital tattoos, to name a
   few examples. In keeping with the Google Glass phenomenon, these devices
   are often talked about long before they are available for purchase or
   use. In a sense, digital media are invented, designed, adopted and even
   celebrated before society is able to understand their impact on lives,
   culture, art, privacy, and social practices. More so, society clings to
   the belief that their emergence is imminent, creating an aura that
   impedes our assessment of them. Based on an ongoing project that uses
   digital rhetoric and digital humanities methodologies to explore
   wearables and their invention, this paper argues that emergent
   technology can spawn dehumanizing representations while it strives for
   the opposite, more human-centric interaction with computers. As we
   design digital devices to augment our physical existence, how are we
   altering the way people conceptualize so many other aspects of humanity
   such as creativity, analytical reasoning, nostalgia, imagination, and
   privacy. When mainstream media celebrate technology such as Google Glass
   and so many other new wearable devices, we need to take a much closer
   look at how they frame us, our culture, our society. This research uses
   a humanities model to uncover assumptions made in the language of
   invention in order to reveal how humans are conceptualized and
   misconceptualized. As future-proposed technology marches on, we need to
   understand the concepts driving the devices that inventors create, but
   also the social structuring and identity-building that humans endure in
   this process.

AB In “Book as an Event,” we discuss the Russian translation of Franco
   Moretti’s Distant Reading, a book that was an intellectual challenge and
   methodological provocation in Anglo-American humanities scholarship from
   the moment of its publication (2013). In the Russian context, it has
   provoked no less lively and productive disagreements-regarding both
   possible ways of broadening the purview of philological research and the
   potential digital future of the humanities as a whole. No less
   interesting, and no less controversial, was the conceptual model that
   Moretti proposed as his approach: a combination of formalism,
   evolutionary theory, and the world-systems analysis of Immanuel
   Wallerstein, together with the technology of the digital humanities.
Z4 В рубрике «Книга как событие» обсуждается русский перевод книги Франко
   Моретти «Дальнее чтение» - книги, ставшей интеллектуальным вызовом и
   методологической провокацией в англо-американской гуманитаристике сразу
   после выхода (2013). В российском контексте она вызвала не менее яркие и
   плодотворные дискуссии - как о возможных концептуальных расширениях
   исследовательского поля филологии, так и о потенциальном цифровом
   будущем гуманитарных наук в целом. Не менее интересной (и в то же время
   дискуссионной) оказалась и концептуальная модель, которую Моретти
   предложил в качестве своего подхода, - совмещение формалистского метода,
   эволюционной теории и мир-системного анализа Иммануила Валлерстайна, а
   также технологий digital humanities.

AB The development and innovative application of digital research methods
   in humanities disciplines, characterised as Digital Humanities or
   e-Humanities, is an established feature of the e-Science and e-Research
   landscape. Typically these digital methods enable existing research
   questions to be tackled in new ways, at a scale and speed that transcend
   manual methods. In this paper we present a different approach to the
   application of digital techniques to humanities research, a branch of
   experimental humanities in which digital experiments bring insight and
   engagement with historical scenarios and in turn influence our
   understanding and our thinking today. We illustrate this through a
   series of experiments and demonstrations inspired by the work of Ada
   Lovelace and Charles Babbage, including simulation of the Analytical
   Engine, use of a web-based music application, construction of hardware,
   and reproduction of earlier mathematical results using contemporary
   computational methods.

AB With advances in technology and culture, our language changes. We invent
   new words, add or change meanings of existing words and change names of
   existing things. Unfortunately, our language does not carry a memory;
   words, expressions and meanings used in the past are forgotten over
   time. When searching and interpreting content from archives, language
   changes pose a great challenge. In this paper, we present results of
   automatic word sense change detection and show the utility for archive
   users as well as digital humanities' research. Our method is able to
   capture changes that relate to the usage and culture of a word that
   cannot easily be found using dictionaries or other resources.

   affordances of Web 2.0 and other tools can be realised in innovative
   ways to help achieve skills development within the medical humanities.
   The guidance, alongside the practical suggestions for implementation,
   can provide important conceptual background for medical humanities

AB Modern information environment imposes new requirements on the system of
   the humanitarian knowledge and has a significant impact on the
   humanities, providing scientists with ample opportunities for
   cooperation, opening a whole range of new research methods. The article
   examines Digital Humanities as one of the promising directions of
   development of the humanities in the digital age. Digital humanities
   development clearly shows that computerization helps new synthesis of
   humanities and natural sciences, helps to overcome their alienation from
   each other. Digital Humanities are considered in the project as an
   interdisciplinary field of research that combines methods and practice
   of humanitarian, social and computational sciences to explore the
   possibilities of the application and interpretation of new digital and
   information-communicational technologies in the humanities and
   education. The article presents the results of the analysis of the 323
   world centers of Digital Humanities identified during the study. The
   analysis revealed the organizational forms of research and education
   centers working in Digital Humanities, defined the infrastructure of
   research in the field of Digital Humanities at the world’s leading
   centers, localized these centers on the world map. Most of the
   structures support interdisciplinary research in their university,
   promote the use of digital technologies in humanities research, advise
   and provide technical assistance to the humanities, regularly conduct
   seminars and workshops on the topics of Digital Humanities. This is
   reflected in the organizational forms: a significant part of research
   and educational institutions working in the field of Digital Humanities
   are represented by the modern form typical of the organizational
   structure of interdisciplinary research: centers, laboratories, groups,
   schools and others. Applied methods of Digital Humanities are used as a
   model to represent the results. The description for each Digital
   Humanities Center includes its name, a brief description of the
   activity, creation date, address, manager’s name and contacts, a link to
   the site. The purpose and basic tools for creating interactive maps
   “World Centers of Digital Humanities”, methods of result presentation in
   Google Maps Engine, difficulties arising in the course of work and ways
   to overcome them are described. The results of the research allow to
   determine the place of Digital Humanities among numerous options of
   identification of humanities developing in the conditions of information
   society and / or on the basis of ICT (e-Humanities, e-Science,
   e-History, humanitarian informatics, etc.). This article is written with

AB We introduce a projection-space interaction tool (Digital Canvas) which
   can be used for visual environments. Using Digital Canvas, users are
   allowed to interact with the visual items on the same space where they
   are displayed. Digital Canvas has resolved some limitations of previous
   interaction tools by merging interaction space and display space,
   providing tangible interface, and allowing for intuitive and natural
   interfaces. Digital Canvas was successfully used for digital painting
   education and a virtual environment manipulation. As a painting tool, it
   provided tactile feedback, freedom of choosing painting tools, erasable
   and undoable procedures, and an interface that is similar to traditional
   painting. As a virtual environment interaction tool, Digital Canvas
   allowed for projection-space tangible interactions using physical
   objects.

AB The rapidly developing field of digital humanities (DH) is showing how
   unprecedented volumes of data such as written expression can be studied
   to reveal new insights into humans and, therefore, into individual and
   collective experiences within and across societies. Scholars from
   disciplines such as literature and history are collaborating with
   scientists from disciplines such as statistics and computer science.
   Moreover, these interdisciplinary teams often reach beyond campuses to
   companies as well as local, national, and international public and
   nonprofit institutions. Surprisingly, the computational research that
   began in the humanities in the 1950s did not develop an important
   presence within mainstream scholarship until half a century later. The
   DH experiences thus far reflect the complexity of both human expression
   and research collaborations across diverse fields and sectors. Learning
   from past successes and failures will help meet today's data analytic
   challenges and prepare us for opportunities in statistical applications
   ranging from literary studies and cybersecurity to business intelligence
   and health indicators.

AB While the use of tools is not new for the sciences, the, traditionally,
   qualitative research methods driven humanities were using tools
   scarcely. The increasing use of computer-aided methods within the
   humanities has been summarized as 'computational turn' [36], digital
   humanities [4, 7], eResearch [25] and/or eHumanities [41]. In the
   Humanities, scholars are in the unique position to actively question the
   relatively new role and influence of tools on research. Such reflection,
   however, need not be limited to the Humanities, but holds value for both
   scholars and scientists. Digital tools and data have changed the
   production of knowledge [22, 26, 34]. Although there has been attention
   to biases in digital tools, discussions have been scattered not only
   across monographs, articles and book chapters lacking a proper label,
   but also tend to remain in their respective academic bubbles. Different
   methods have emerged, each embedded in their own fields. In this paper
   we reflect on the novel practices of digital methods and data analysis
   in the humanities and discuss the epistemic impact of knowledge
   technology, more generally. Consequently, this paper argues for the
   development of a rigorous inquiry into the tools used for research to be
   an essential element of the overall research process. We dub this
   enquiry 'tool criticism'. Tool criticism paves the way to move from
   digital methods [32, 33] to 'digital methodology'.

   and investigated the concepts of techno-animism and digital ensoulment
   of jewellery. By going back to the roots of jewellery design, we
   investigate the cultural and social importance of the jewellery
   components and making techniques and propose a set of guidelines that
   consider data collection as a fundamental component of the creation
   process. Our findings are based on two research based jewellery-making
   workshops, along with a technology review and our guidelines aim to
   provide a set of accessible and actionable suggestions for the design of
   future technology-enhanced jewellery.

   method. Our method represents metadata values in Japanese and English as
   vectors by using monolingual word embeddings. Then, we calculate
   similarity between metadata value vectors by learning a mapping between

   could help users to acquire multilingual information of the objects in

   When applied to infrastructures, the concept of usability needs to be
   extended to other aspects such as the interoperability between several
   infrastructure components. In this paper, we present the results of
   several usability studies. Our aim was not only to test the usability of
   single tools but also to assess the extent to which different tools and
   devices can be seamlessly integrated into a single digital research
   workflow. Our findings suggest that more resources need be spent on
   testing of digital tools and infrastructure components and that it is
   especially important to conduct user tests covering the whole knowledge

   is capable of creating three-dimensional "Research focus parallelship
   network" and "Keyword Co-occurrence Network", together with
   two-dimensional knowledge map. The networks and knowledge maps can be
   depicted differently by choosing different information as network actor,
   i.e. country, institute, paper and keyword, to reflect knowledge
   structures form macro, meso, to micro-levels. The quantitative
   exploration provides a way to visualize and assess the development of
   "Digital Humanity" to encourage the formation of this emerging research

   research. Historians use tools to query larger data sets and they apply
   a different methodology to tackle certain research questions. In this
   paper we will discuss two propositions on the necessity of adapting to
   and taking advantage of the technological changes: (1) Digital
   Humanities tools are not the enemy of the historian, but they need to be
   used in a proper way. This requires historians to make 'tool criticism'
   part of their methodological toolkit; (2) Digital Humanities tools allow
   for a more data-driven and bottom-up approach to historical research.
   This eliminates some of the historian's preconceptions that are
   inevitably part of more traditional historical research.

   of trusting others, using Digital Humanities as a focus, and drawing on

   its use in scholarship demands better practices and terminology, to
   review research software and describe development processes. It is also
   important to make research software engineers and their work more
   visible, both for the purposes of review and credit.

AB Motivated by the increasing demand for computerized analysis of
   documents within the Digital Humanities we present an approach to
   automating handwritten cuneiform character recognition on vectorized
   cuneiform tablets. Cuneiform is one of the oldest handwritten scripts
   used for more than three millennia. In previous work we have shown how
   to extract vector drawings from 3D-models of cuneiform tablets similar
   to those manually drawn over digital photographs. We approach the
   problem of recognizing these characters by applying pattern matching
   against the basic structural features of cuneiform, the wedge-shaped
   impressions. Then, we find an optimal assignment between the wedge
   configuration of two characters w.r.t. wedge shape and position. The
   similarity of two characters is measured by the quality of the
   assignment. We compare our method against well known methods for
   handwritten character recognition with favorable results for our method.

   the arts, humanities and social sciences (AHSS). It will do so vis-a-vis
   current citation conventions and impact measurement for research in
   AHSS. Case study findings on research data inventoried at Goldsmiths',
   University of London will be presented. Goldsmiths is a UK
   research-intensive higher education institution which specialises in
   arts, humanities and social science research. The paper's aim is to
   raise awareness of the subject-specific needs of AHSS scholars to help
   inform the design of future digital tools for impact analysis in AHSS.
   Firstly, I shall explore the definition of research data and how it is
   currently understood by AHSS researchers. I will show why many
   researchers choose not to engage with digital dissemination techniques
   and ORCID. This discussion must necessarily include the idea that
   practice-based and applied AHSS research are processes which are not
   easily captured in numerical 'sets' and cannot be labelled
   electronically without giving careful consideration to what a group or
   data item 'represents' as part of the academic enquiry, and therefore
   how it should be cited and analysed as part of any impact assessment.
   Then, the paper will explore: the role of the monograph and arts
   catalogue in AHSS scholarship; how citation practices and digital impact
   measurement in AHSS currently operate in relation to authorship and how
   digital identifiers may hypothetically impact on metrics, intellectual
   property (IP), copyright and research integrity issues in AHSS. I will
   also show that, if we are to be truly interdisciplinary, as research
   funders and strategic thinkers say we should, it is necessary to revise
   the way we think about digital research dissemination. This will involve
   breaking down the boundaries between AHSS and other types of research.

AB Numerous digital libraries projects maintain their data collections in
   the form of text, images, and metadata. While data may be stored in many
   formats, from plain text to XML to relational databases, the use of the
   resource description framework (RDF) as a standardized representation
   has gained considerable traction during the last five years. Almost
   every digital humanities meeting has at least one session concerned with
   the topic of digital humanities, RDF, and linked data, including JCDL.
   While most existing work in linked data has focused on improving
   algorithms for entity matching, the aim of our Linked Open Data Enhancer
   LODE is to work "out of the box", enabling their use by humanities
   scholars, computer scientists, librarians, and information scientists
   alike.
   With LODE we enable non-technical users to enrich a local RDF repository
   with high-quality data from the Linked Open Data cloud. LODE links and
   enhances the local RDF repository without reducing the quality of the
   data. In particular, we support the user in the enhancement and linking
   process by providing intuitive user-interfaces and by suggesting high
   quality linking candidates using state of the art matching algorithms.
   We hope that the LODE framework will be useful to digital humanities
   scholars complementing other digital humanities tools. (1)

AB Digital access to large amounts of scholarly text presents both
   challenges and opportunities for researchers in the humanities. Meeting
   these challenges depends on having high-quality representations of the
   contents of digital resources suitable for both machines and humans to
   use. Different ways of categorizing these contents are appropriate for
   different purposes, leading to the further problem of relating the
   contents of different categorization schemes to each other. This essay
   discusses the rationale for categorizing philosophical concepts and
   surveys some of the main approaches to doing so for materials that are
   continuously changing. It describes the goals and methods of the Indiana
   Philosophy Ontology (InPhO) project and provides an example of the kind
   of analysis that is made possible by powerful modeling methods.

AB Digital humanities is a research field focused on the intersection of
   computer science and the humanities. The development of new search,
   analysis, personalisation and collaboration tools are some examples of
   how information technology has hugely benefited humanities
   practitioners. Despite the obvious benefits computers bring, users often
   feel a lack of control over, or understanding of, the automatic
   processing underlying digital humanities systems. This control is
   important to curators of digital archives who need to maintain the
   integrity of their collection, as well as to end users who might not
   understand why they are receiving particular recommendations or search
   results. The CULTURA project is developing a next-generation digital
   humanities portal, which provides users with more control over the
   underlying systems and makes more transparent the processes involved.
   This paper discusses this with reference to entity extraction and
   personalisation techniques.

AB This paper will argue that a cooperation is necessary between the fields
   of humanitiescontents and traditional humanities in exploring the
   potential of digital humanities.Digital humanities refers to all new
   types of humanities research, education, and creativeprojects enabled by
   information technology. The definition is not limited to studies of
   traditionalhumanities topics using information technology as a research
   method; but it also includescompletely new forms of humanities research
   realized by the use of computers.Digital humanities can be beneficial to
   both humanities and cultural contents. For thetraditional humanities
   studies, digital humanities will contribute to a wide dissemination
   ofhumanities knowledge in society; for cultural contents, digital
   humanities will provide the mostefficient medium to acquire humanities
   knowledge for application in the cultural industry.In order for the
   cultural contents to contain digital humanities, I suggest that
   educationprograms of the cultural contents departments should train some
   of their students in informationtechnology to raise them as humanities
   knowledge coordinators. These coordinators should beequipped with not
   only the basic humanities knowledge, but also the
   information-processingskills to systemize the knowledge into digital 
   contents. In case of Korea, where there is ashortage of professionals in
   the field of digital humanities, it is difficult for colleges
   toindependently run digital humanities programs. But with open
   educational opportunities such asDigital Humanities Conference, it will
   be possible with just a few human resources to distributeknowledge and
   ideas to a large audience.
AK 인문콘텐츠학계와 전통적인 인문학계가 공동으로 관심으로 가져야 할 과제로‘디지털 인문학’(Digital Humanities)의
   가능성에 주목해 볼 것을 제안한다.디지털 인문학이란 정보기술(Information Technology)의 도움을 받아 새로운
   방식으로 수행하는 인문학 연구와 교육, 그리고 이와 관계된 창조적인 저작활동을 지칭하는 말이다. 이것은 전통적인 인문학의 주제를
   계승하면서 연구 방법면에서 디지털 기술을 활용하는 연구, 그리고 예전에는 가능하지 않았지만 컴퓨터를 사용함으로써 시도할 수 있게
   된 새로운 성격의 인문학 연구를 포함한다.순수 인문학의 입장에서 보면 디지털 인문학은 인문지식의 사회적 확산을 돕는길이고,
   인문콘텐츠학의 입장에서 보면 그것은 문화산업에 응용할 방대한 인문학지식을 가장 효과적으로 획득하는 방법을 마련하는 일이다. 미국과
   유럽, 심지어는가까운 일본과 대만의 상황을 보더라도 디지털 인문학의 육성은 범인문학계(인문학+인문콘텐츠학)의 자연스러운 발전
   궤도상에 있는 과제이다.인문콘텐츠학이 디지털 인문학을 수용하기 위해 우선적으로 해야 할 일은 문화콘텐츠학과에서 배출하는 인력의
   일부를 인문정보기술의 운용 능력을 갖춘 지식코디네이터로 육성하는 일이다. 이들은 인문지식에 대한 기본적인 소양뿐 아니라그곳에서
   생산되는 지식을 디지털 콘텐츠로 조직화하는 정보 처리 능력을 갖추고있는 사람들이다. 디지털 인문학의 전문 인력이 절대적으로 부족한
   우리나라 현실에서 대학마다 독립적으로 이 분야의 정규 교과 과정을 운영하기는 힘들다. 하지만학회 차원에서 누구나 참여할 수 있는
   개방적인 교육 기회를 마련한다면, 소수의교수 인력만 가지고도 다수에게 그 지식을 전달하는 효과를 거둘 수 있을 것이다.

AB Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a description and reflection on
   some of the structural problems and challenges faced when developing a
   digital humanities (DH) project in a Mexican public university.
   Design/methodology/approach - As DH is a relatively new field and
   practice in Mexican academia, this article is based on a case study of
   developing the Biblioteca Digital de Pensamiento Novohispano (Digital
   Library of New Hispanic Thought). This is one of the few DH at the
   Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), the largest public
   university in the country.
   Findings - It was found that there were three central problems for
   developing a DH project in a Mexican public university: existing
   technical knowledge and abilities at the UNAM will be challenged by DH
   projects; projects are the place to train human resources in DH
   methodology; and researchers need to consider different long-term
   infrastructure and hosting solutions, with or without using
   institutional infrastructure, at the same time researches need to work
   within the institution to establish a specific policy for research
   projects.
   Practical implications - The paper concludes that the structure, goals
   and products of DH projects need to be modified and expanded in order to
   also consider alternative goals and products such as: proposals of
   institutional policy, creation of infrastructure and academic and
   student training. DH projects must be regarded as disruptive, that is
   that the project needs to assume rupture as a part of the project
   itself.
   Originality/value - The experience of innovation and disruption is not
   necessarily the same in all fields and all institutions. This article
   documents for the first time the particular experiences of a public
   university in a developing country with DH projects. It has been found
   that the delay in using computers in the humanities in Mexico has led to
   the development of a specific paradox: a gap between institutional
   interest and disposition in the use of computers in humanities, and the
   lack of DH culture in those who have to develop the project.

   to perform metadata mapping automatically for Japanese heterogeneous
   humanities digital libraries and (2) to let users access multiple
   humanities digital libraries by using only one query input. The proposed
   automatic metadata mapping method produced the average mapping precision
   of 94.9%. We also address the metadata-related challenges facing
   Japanese humanities databases.

AB Cultural heritage digital libraries hold promise both as a new tool for
   representing the complex information structures frequently found in the
   humanities and social sciences and as interactive environments that
   enable scholars to work with this information in new ways throughout the
   research project. Much attention has been paid to digitization, textual
   encoding, metadata and dissemination of digital cultural heritage data.
   Scholars now routinely turn toward electronic sources as a first step in
   their information finding process. Considerably less attention, however,
   has been devoted to understanding how to support the formative stages of
   scholarly research.
   In this paper, we highlight our finding from a formative user study of
   scholarly analysis of source documents in several different fields. We
   discuss the implications of these results for our current research into
   designing a web-based creativity support environment for cultural
   heritage digital libraries.

AB Purpose This article aims to understand how social enterprises adopt
   crowdfunding in digital humanities by investigating the mission
   drifting, risk sharing and human resource practices.
   Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study uses a qualitative
   method by observing five different social ventures in Indonesia. The
   case study involves observation of social enterprises that concern
   digital humanities projects and interviews with those who manage the
   crowdfunding for financing the projects as the key respondents. The
   analysis uses an interpretative approach by involving the respondents to
   explain the phenomena. Findings (1) Adopting the crowdfunding platform
   encourages social enterprises to reshape social missions with more
   responsive action for digital humanities. (2) Crowdfunding allows social
   enterprises to share the risk with stakeholders who focus on fostering
   the social impact of digital humanities. (3) Crowdfunding stimulates
   social enterprises to hire professional workers with flexible work
   arrangements to attract specific donors and investors. Originality/value
   The result extends the principles of social enterprises by introducing
   some concepts of crowdfunding in digital humanities. This study also
   explains the boundary conditions of digital humanities projects and how
   crowdfunding can support the projects by adopting the principles of the
   social enterprise that works on digital humanities projects.

   directions of research. Three generations of portals are identified: Ten
   years ago the research focus in semantic portal development was on data
   harmonization, aggregation, search, and browsing ("first generation
   systems"). At the moment, the rise of Digital Humanities research has
   started to shift the focus to providing the user with integrated tools
   for solving research problems in interactive ways ("second generation
   systems"). This paper envisions and argues that the next step ahead to
   "third generation systems" is based on Artificial Intelligence: future
   portals not only provide tools for the human to solve problems but are
   used for finding research problems in the first place, for addressing
   them, and even for solving them automatically under the constraints set
   by the human researcher. Such systems should preferably be able to
   explain their reasoning, which is an important aspect in the source
   critical humanities research tradition. The second and third generation
   systems set new challenges for both computer scientists and humanities
   researchers.

AB Since the mid-18th century, the industrial revolution has evolved into
   the fourth industrial revolution, driven by the digital revolution. The
   starting point of the Fourth Industrial Revolution can be found in the
   establishment of Germany’s high-tech strategy, as a manufacturing
   powerhouse, that will continue to lead the competition in the future. To
   this end, from 2004 until today, the German government has supported a
   large number of projects. The results of the first study were announced
   by Merkel in August 2006 as a “high-tech strategy”, followed by a
   manufacturing innovation strategy called “Industrial 4.0” in 2010 and a
   “fourth industrial revolution” in 2016.The key to penetrating this
   series of processes is digitization. Digitization leads to qualitative
   changes in the industrial environment, resulting in qualitative changes
   in labor, and further demands for qualitative changes in education. In
   order to successfully innovate manufacturing, other social conditions
   require innovative solutions to be realized.This paper examines what
   humanities look for in Germany during this Fourth Industrial Revolution.
   To this end, I would like to examine the correlation between the
   emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Digital
   Revolution, and briefly examine the digital humanities that emerged as a
   new branch of the humanities and industry 4.0-labor 4.0-vocational
   education 4.0 reflecting German characteristics. In this way, I would
   like to suggest an aspect of the practical use of German humanities in
   relation to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
AK 18세기 중엽 이후 등장한 산업혁명이 디지털 혁명에 힘입어 4차 산업 혁명으로 진화하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명으로의 출발점은,
   제조업 강국으로서 미래에도 국가경쟁에서 우위를 차지하려는 독일의 하이테크 전략 수립에서 찾을 수 있다. 이를 위해 독일 정부는
   2004년부터 오늘날까지 방대한 프로젝트들을 지원하고 있으며, 그 첫 연구 결과는 2006년 8월 ‘하이테크 전략’으로
   발표되었고, 2010년에는 ‘인더스트리 4.0’이라는 제조업의 혁신전략으로, 2016년에는 공식화된 ‘4차 산업혁명’으로
   이어졌다.이 일련의 과정들에서 관통하는 핵심은 디지털화이다. 디지털화는 산업 환경의 질적 변화는 물론 노동의 질적 변화를 요구하고
   있으며, 더 나아가서 이것은 교육의 질적 혁신으로 실현될 수밖에 없음으로 인식되고 있다. 성공적인 제조업의 혁신을 위해서는 그와
   맞물린 다른 사회적 여건들에서도 혁신적인 솔루션이 실현되어야 하는 것이다.본 논문은, 4차 산업혁명의 과정에서 노동과 교육 영역에
   요청된 혁신의 기반이 디지털화이고 그것에 관련된 인문학의 새로운 방법론 모색에 이르는 과정을 살펴보고자 한다. 이를 위해 4차
   산업혁명의 출현과 독일적 특성에 따른 인더스트리 4.0-노동4.0-직업교육4.0, 더 나아가 인문학의 새로운 분과로 등장한 디지털
   인문학에 이르는 일련의 과정이 고찰될 것이다. 이로써 본 논문은 4차 산업혁명과 관련해서 독일의 인문학이 실용화 되는 한 단면을
   제시하려 한다.

AB Requirements for the analysis, interpretation and reuse of information
   are becoming more and more ambitious as we generate larger and more
   complex datasets. This is leading to the development and widespread use
   of information about information, often called metainformation (or
   metadata) in most disciplines. The Digital Humanities are not an
   exception. We often assume that metainformation helps us in documenting
   information for future reference by recording who has created it, when
   and how, among other aspects. We also assume that recording
   metainformation will facilitate the tasks of interpreting information at
   later stages. However, some works have identified some issues with
   existing metadata approaches, related to 1) the proliferation of too
   many "standards" and difficulties to choose between them; 2) the
   generalized assumption that metadata and data (or metainformation and
   information) are essentially different, and the subsequent development
   of separate sets of languages and tools for each (introducing redundant
   models); and 3) the combination of conceptual and implementation
   concerns within most approaches, violating basic engineering principles
   of modularity and separation of concerns. Some of these problems are
   especially relevant in Digital Humanities.
   In addition, we argue here that the lack of characterization of the
   scenarios in which metainformation plays a relevant role in humanistic
   projects often results in metainformation being recorded and managed
   without a specific purpose in mind. In turn, this hinders the process of
   decision making on issues such as what metainformation must be recorded
   in a specific project, and how it must be conceptualized, stored and
   managed.
   This paper presents a review of the most used metadata approaches in
   Digital Humanities and, taking a conceptual modelling perspective,
   analyses their major issues as outlined above. It also describes what
   the most common scenarios for the use of metainformation in Digital
   Humanities are, presenting a characterization that can assist in the
   setting of goals for metainformation recording and management in each
   case. Based on these two aspects, a new approach is proposed for the
   conceptualization, recording and management of metainformation in the
   Digital Humanities, using the ConML conceptual modelling language, and
   adopting the overall view that metainformation is not essentially
   different to information. The proposal is validated in Digital
   Humanities scenarios through case studies employing real-world datasets.

   involved in the realization of a digital humanities project, the 3-D
   modeling of the city of Pavia, Italy, as it was in the 16th century.
   Traditional lectures introduced key theoretical elements, but students
   were subsequently given specific assignments and retrieved additional
   content when completing the tasks assigned to them under the overall

   understand the expectations and use of digital editions of texts. The
   survey, modelled upon a detailed analysis of 242 projects, recorded 218
   complete responses, shedding light on user requirements of digital
   editions. Specifically, the survey indicates that issues of data reuse,
   licensing, image availability, and comprehensive documentation are the
   most requested features of digital editions, although ones which seldom
   are provided. This analysis feeds into previous studies on good practice
   in building Digital Humanities resources and puts forward practical
   recommendations for both creators and funders of digital editions in an
   effort to promote a stronger consideration of user needs. This survey
   will be of interest to those who produce digital editions of texts,
   including developers and engineers, and will also be of interest to
   those who commission and fund these projects, such as universities,
   libraries, and archives, whose documentary collections are often

AB Digital humanities is an academic field applying computational methods
   to explore topics and questions in the humanities field. Digital
   humanities projects, as a result, consist of a variety of creative works
   different from those in traditional humanities disciplines. Born to
   provide free, simple ways to grant permissions to creative works,
   Creative Commons (CC) licenses have become top options for many digital
   humanities scholars to handle intellectual property rights in the US.
   However, there are limitations of using CC licenses that are sometimes
   unknown by scholars and academic librarians. By analyzing case studies
   and influential lawsuits about intellectual property rights in the
   digital age, this article advocates for a critical perspective of
   copyright education and provides academic librarians with specific
   recommendations about advising digital humanities scholars to use CC
   licenses with four limitations in mind: 1) the pitfall of a free
   license; 2) the risk of irrevocability; 3) the ambiguity of Non
   Commercial and Non Derivative licenses; 4) the dilemma of ShareAlike and
   the open movement.

AB The whole academic area of humanities has been facing a massive decline
   around the world: the number of students, their job opportunities and
   financial budgets have been steadily shrinking. So, in the Information
   Age, something must be done to improve the current situation: the
   digitization of the literary text to attract many more people in a more
   accessible way using multimedia features. Readers are required to have a
   wide range of background knowledge to understand the scholastic texts of
   James Joyce which cover Irish history, Christianity and European
   cultures. There have been various kinds of annotations, guidebooks and
   academic books about Joyce’s works in book form. Recently, numerous
   websites related to James Joyce have been developed in order to offer
   annotations and articles free of charge. James Joyce himself was very
   interested in the progress of technology as he described some aspects of
   the early twentieth-century technological culture in his literary works.

AB This paper is the author’s personal experience and interpretation whilst
   participating in Professor Kyung-Sook Shin’s English Literature graduate
   course, “Literature and Technology II: Feminisms and Digital
   Humanities,” during the 2019 spring semester at Yonsei University, South
   Korea. Exploring the intersections of literary feminist theory and
   digital humanities, this paper examines not only the content, but also
   the methodology and political effects of collaboratively digitally
   annotating Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s epic novel/poem, Aurora Leigh
   (1856) through the modest medium, Google Docs. In particular, this paper
   observes the students’ interaction with the digital tools and
   literature-related pedagogy in two main parts. First, the democratic
   political nature of classroom culture when creating a new language/code
   during annotation. Second, the coexistence of cyberspace and the
   physical classroom space and its effect on time, specifically in the
   archival of the past, influencing of the future, and the splitting into
   the present multiverse. From a student’s perspective in digital literary
   annotation, this paper shows that technology could become a way to
   decolonize and reprogram education to be inclusive, collaborative, and

AB This study examines cases of digital humanities education programs at
   universities, university libraries and digital humanities centers in the
   United States. As a result of the research, it was analyzed that the
   university-centered education program operates in conjunction with other
   departments to take courses related to humanities and digital technology
   in general. The digital humanities education program is not operated as
   a full degree program, but most programs are operated as graduate
   certificate programs, and it is required to require a graduate degree in
   library and information science and humanities in advance. Most of the
   digital humanities centers run educational programs centered on faculty
   and postdoctoral researchers in universities in connection with
   universities and university libraries to support the humanities
   scholars. Lastly, the university's digital humanities education program
   is operated in the form of research support for students and researchers
   of all majors. In addition, the content of the educational program
   focused on the practice for digital projects rather than theory.
   Empowering digital literacy and supporting digital technology-based
   research has become a new role for university libraries, which requires
   libraries to play a central role in digital humanities education.
AK 본 연구는 미국의 대학, 대학도서관 및 디지털 인문학 센터의 디지털 인문학 교육 프로그램에 대한 사례를 조사한 것이다. 연구의
   결과 대학 중심의 교육 프로그램은 타 학과와 연계하여 인문학 및 디지털 기술의 관련된 강좌를 전반적으로 수강할 수 있도록 하는
   프로그램을 운영하고 있는 것으로 분석되었다. 또한 디지털 인문학 교육 프로그램은 완전한 학위 과정으로 운영하기 보다는 대학원
   수료증 과정으로 운영되며, 이수를 위해서는 사전에 문헌정보학 및 인문학의 대학원 학위를 필수로 요구하는 기관이 대부분인 것으로
   조사되었다. 디지털 인문학 센터는 인문학 전공자의 연구지원을 위해 대학 및 대학도서관과 연계하여 대학 내의 교수진 및 박사 후
   연구원 등을 중심으로 교육 프로그램을 운영하고 있으며, 프로그램의 유형은 워크숍 또는 수료증 과정이었다. 한편, 대학도서관의 교육
   프로그램은 대학의 모든 전공의 학생 및 연구자를 대상으로 연구지원의 형식으로 운영하고 있으며, 교육 프로그램의 내용은 이론
   중심보다는 디지털 프로젝트를 위한 실습에 중점을 두고 있어 대학도서관은 가장 다양한 이용자를 대상으로 실용적인 디지털 인문학
   프로그램을 운영하고 있는 것으로 파악되었다. 디지털 리터러시의 역량을 키우고 디지털 기술을 기반으로 한 연구를 수행할 수 있도록
   지원하는 것은 대학도서관의 새로운 역할이 되었고 이를 위하여 도서관이 디지털 인문학 교육에 있어 중심적인 역할을 수행해야 하는
   것은 분명하다. 또한 이러한 프로그램을 운영하기 위한 전문가를 양성하기 위하여 문헌정보학과에서 디지털 인문학 교육도 함께
   검토되어야 할 것이다.

AB Research in digital humanities involves the need for conscious and
   explicit handling of data uncertainty. Recently, some initiatives have
   highlighted the importance of considering this uncertainty from the
   conceptual model to the final phases of implementation of software
   tools. Although the conceptual proposals for handling data uncertainty
   in the humanities have proliferated successfully, there is still a gap
   in bringing these proposals to actual implementations of software
   systems, especially due to the need to quantify this uncertainty and
   adopt more analytical paradigms based on margins of error, away from the
   conceptualization of data in the humanities. Trying to close this gap
   and avoid these paradigms, this paper presents a framework based on
   fuzzy logic that implements aspects of epistemic uncertainty
   (uncertainty related to our knowledge about the object of study) in
   digital humanities, providing algebraic and computational support to
   implementation. The framework proposes a solution to implement software
   systems that manage epistemic uncertainty, allowing comparisons,
   aggregations or reasoning with various levels of uncertainty in
   humanistic data. The solution is implemented in a real digital
   humanities project, illustrating its possibilities.

   International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing
   Multiculturality, continues the endeavor, started in 2018, to reflect on
   the challenges and issues that uncertainty poses with special focus on
   Digital Humanities (DH). The main goal of this track is to trigger the
   discussion around the manifestation and challenges regarding
   uncertainty. In particular, the track is interested in the following: 1)
   recognizing the nature and effect of uncertainty in the different
   (computational and humanistic) processes that take part in any DH
   project; 2) and proposing novel approaches, techniques, models, etc.
   that can help to mitigate the complexity that uncertainty brings. This
   year the track will be two-folded. On the one hand, three papers will be
   presented during the regular session. On the other hand, an interactive
   and meta-disciplinary workshop, open to any participant of the
   Conference, will be organized to foster a participatory approach towards
   a better understanding of the nuances and opportunities of uncertainty
   in DH. The workshop aims to apply Open Innovation methods and practices
   to transfer learnings and methods of various non-DH disciplines to DH
   (and vice versa) under the focus of uncertainty and co-deign a taxonomy
   of uncertainty.

AB This paper explored the fusion study method of Buddhism and digital
   issues from the viewpoint of digital humanities. First of all, the
   problem of the quality of the data currently held by Buddhist data
   centers in the area of data and the solutions were discussed, centering
   on the concept of machine-readable data and the semantic web. I
   emphasized the Semantic Web concept, which is able to describe various
   semantic relations of humanities among machine readable data, which is
   important to inform computer more information from the concept of human
   readable data. Based on this, the Buddhist AI ethical model, which is an
   application model for a digital Buddhist knowledge system, was proposed
   and a method for upgrading Buddhist data was specifically put
   forward.Then, in the area of ​​analysis and interpretation, I discussed
   the present situation with and possibilities of language analysis,
   social network analysis, and spatial analysis. Regarding linguistic
   analysis, the “CBETA digital research platform” and “Leishu
   Corresponding Inquiry System” (類書對應查詢系統) were introduced, and the
   possibility of Buddhist research using the language analysis method was
   suggested. In the analysis of social networks, I introduced the
   “visualization of the Memoirs of Eminent Monks (高僧傳) social network” and
   “Mapping the Republic of Letters” projects and suggested the possibility
   of studying Buddhism using network analysis. In the spatial analysis, I
   introduced the “Gaoseng Zhuan GIS system” (佛教傳記文學地理資訊系統) and “the drift
   node visual network in the Joseon Dynasty,” and suggested the
   possibility of studying Buddhism using spatial analysis.Finally, in the
   visualization part, I introduced the “CBETA online reading” (線上閱讀) and
   “digital storytelling resource development of Korean documentary
   heritage,” described the visualization of Buddhist data. Visualization
   for researchers is the maximization of research efficiency through
   linkage of original information and research information. Multimedia
   visualization for general Buddhism uses a new technology (virtual
   reality, augmented reality, etc.) that can be used in digital by moving
   away from the paper medium and enhancing accessibility to subjects in
   which general Buddhist texts are difficult to understand or difficult to
   access can do.
AK 본 논문은 디지털인문학의 관점에서 불교학과 디지털의 융합 연구 방법에 대해서 모색하였다. 우선 데이터의 영역에서 현재 불교
   데이터가 안고 있는 데이터 품질의 문제와 그 해결책에 대해서 기계가독형데이터와 시맨틱웹 개념을 중심으로 논의하였다. 지금까지의
   인간가독형데이터의 개념에서 벗어나서 컴퓨터에게 보다 많은 정보를 알려주는 것을 중요시 하는 기계가독형데이터 중에서도 인문학의
   다양한 의미 관계를 서술할 수 있는 시맨틱웹 개념에 대해서 강조하였다. 그리고 이를 바탕으로 디지털 불교 지식 체계로의 응용모델인
   불교 인공지능 윤리모델을 제안하고, 불교 데이터의 질적 향상을 위한 고도화 방법을 구체적으로 제시하였다.그 다음 분석과 해석의
   영역에서는 언어 분석, 사회네트워크 분석, 공간 분석의 현황과 가능성에 대해서  논의하였다. 언어 분석에서는 CBETA 디지털
   연구 플랫폼과 유서대응검색시스템[類書對應查詢系統]을 소개하였다. 이를 바탕으로 공기어(Co-occurrence)를 통한 불경의
   개념어 간의 관계성에 대한 연구 가능성을 제시하였다. 사회네트워크 분석에서는 고승전 사회네트워크 시각화와 편지 공화국의 지도
   제작을 소개하고, 네트워크 분석을 활용한 불교학 연구를 위한 한국 불교 인물 네트워크 아카이브의 필요성을 서술하였다. 공간
   분석에서는 불교전기문학지리정보시스템과 조선시대 표류노드 시각망 연구를 소개하고, 공간 분석을 활용한 불교 사찰과 풍수 간의 공간
   관계성 분석이나 시대별 승려 출신지의 변화 양상 등의 연구 가능성을 제시하였다.마지막으로 시각화의 영역에서 CBETA 온라인
   열독과 한국 기록유산의 디지털스토리텔링 자원 개발을 소개하고 불교학 데이터와 연구의 시각화에 대해서 서술하였다. 연구자를 위한
   문헌 시각화는 원문 정보와 연구 정보의 상호 연계를 통한 연구 효율의 최대화이다. 그리고 일반 불자를 위한 멀티미디어 시각화는
   종이 매체에서 벗어나 디지털에서 활용 가능한 새로운 기술(가상현실, 증강현실 등)을 활용하여, 일반 불자가 내용을 이해하기
   어렵거나 물리적인 접근이 힘든 대상에 대한 접근성을 향상할 수 있다.

AB The recent generalized digital society has already passed the point of
   pursuing ‘computer literacy’. Recent discussions have developed a new
   discussion on Digital Text Studies in connection with the so-called
   ‘digital humanities’ concept. The concept of text in the digital age
   that we perceive will be a means of communication understood under an
   integrated semantic relation. In the digital aspect, text will be
   understood in terms of information provision. That is, an attempt to
   read out the tension relations existing between the interests more
   interestingly should be the point of digital text studies. In the case
   of cognitive theory based on the concept of digital text, it facilitates
   copying, manipulation and analysis based on the digitization of
   literature / text. On the other hand, the digital task of 'Digital Text
   Studies' is probably to make a futuristic and innovative hypothesis and
   problem consciousness in the humanistic field through this digital text
   concept.In this study, I will try to clarify this theoretical discussion
   from the viewpoint of Walter Benjamin and Friedrich Kittler's media
   aesthetics.
AK 최근의 일반화된 디지털 사회는 ‘컴퓨터 문헌학’이 추구하는 지향점을 이미 지나쳐 버린 것이 아닌가 싶다. 최근의 여러 논의들은
   소위 ‘디지털 휴머니티’ 개념과 연관지어서 새로이 ‘디지털 텍스트 스터디스 Digital Text Studies’에 대한 논의를
   발전시킨바 있다. 디지털 텍스트 스터디스를 언급한다 함은 결코 인간이 지닌 자연어에 기반한 지성을 억누르는 일이 아니며,
   불명료함에 대한 우리의 욕망을 몰아내고자 하는 것이 아니고, 문예학을 0/1로 이뤄진 디지털 논리 체계에 가두려는 시도는 더더욱
   아니다. 디지털 텍스트 연구가 지향하는 바는 아날로그적 텍스트 개념과 디지털 텍스트 개념 사이의 긴장관계를 보다 의미 있게
   만들고자 함이다. 우리가 인식하는 디지털 시대의 텍스트의 개념은 통합적인 의미연관성하에서 이해되어지는 소통의 수단일 것이며,
   디지털적인 측면에서 텍스트는 정보제공의 측면에서 이해되어질 것인지라 즉, 의미와 정보라는 두 측면의 텍스트 이해 사이에 존재하는
   긴장관계를 보다 흥미롭게 새로이 읽어내는 시도가 디지털 텍스트 스터디스의 지향점이 되어야 할 것이다. 디지털적인 텍스트 개념에
   근거한 인지적 이론의 경우에 문학/텍스트의 디지털화에 근거한 모사와 전달, 조작 그리고 분석을 용이하게 한다. 반면에 ‘디지털
   텍스트 스터디스’의 문헌학적 임무는 아마도 이러한 디지털 텍스트 개념을 통해서 미래지향적이며 혁신적인 가설과 문제의식을 인문학적
   영역에 만개하게 하는 것이리라. 본 연구에서는 이러한 이론적 논의를 발터 벤야민과 프리드리히 키틀러의 매체 미학을 통해서
   살펴보고자 한다.

AB While several approaches to bring vision and language together are
   emerging, none of them has yet addressed the digital humanities domain,
   which, nevertheless, is a rich source of visual and textual data. To
   foster research in this direction, we investigate the learning of
   visual-semantic embeddings for historical document illustrations,
   devising both supervised and semi-supervised approaches. We exploit the
   joint visual-semantic embeddings to automatically align illustrations
   and textual elements, thus providing an automatic annotation of the
   visual content of a manuscript. Experiments are performed on the Borso
   d'Este Holy Bible, one of the most sophisticated illuminated manuscript
   from the Renaissance, which we manually annotate aligning every
   illustration with textual commentaries written by experts. Experimental
   results quantify the domain shift between ordinary visual-semantic
   datasets and the proposed one, validate the proposed strategies, and
   devise future works on the same line.

   uncertainty in humanities research and the attributes a digital system
   would ideally have. It draws upon both the experience of a number of
   digital projects and research into the many-faceted concept of
   uncertainty in data. Its intention is to support a dialogue between the
   humanities and computer science, able to realise the promise of digital
   humanities without a reversion to a new positivism in disciplines such
   as history and literary studies.

AB The commentaries by Baldwin (2018), Green (2018), and Porter (2018) on
   the 2 articles (Burman, 2018; Flis & Van Eck, 2018) in this special
   section provide a unique perspective on digital humanities approaches to
   history of psychology. Each of the commentators approached the topic
   through their own lens-Melinda Baldwin as a historian of scientific
   journals, Christopher Green as a pioneer in digital history of
   psychology, and Ted Porter as a historian of quantification. In my
   response, I tried to reply to the 3 comments by critically discussing 4
   themes the special section has raised: the relationship between digital
   history and conventional history, the perspective that takes databases
   as both sources for historians and objects in history, the relationship
   between "thick descriptions" and "thin" digital ones, and finally, the
   role of digital history as a type of a "trading creole" between
   scientists working in quantified disciplines like scientific psychology
   and less quantified ones like history. I think the commentators have
   rightly observed some pitfalls in the uncritical application of digital
   history. On the other hand, in my response, I argue that the careful use
   of digital methods, where the user stays in communication with
   nondigital historians, opens new perspectives for historians of science,
   historians of psychology, and psychologists themselves. Digital methods
   are not there to supplant historicist work but to add to it and
   translate it to new audiences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA,

AB Digital humanities (DH) is a burgeoning field of research in Sinology
   and Asian studies more broadly, and its diversity and maturity
   necessitate a cyberinfrastructure fit for DH-focused Sinologists'
   specific needs. "Asia Network" is our solution. It is a pioneering
   approach for resource dissemination and emerging data analytics (such as
   text mining and other fairuse, consumptive research techniques) in the
   humanities. It is a language-agnostic software that facilitates the
   secure linkage between third-party research tools to different
   third-party textual collections (both licensed and open-access ones) via
   application programming interfaces (APIs). It revolutionizes how
   scholars can work with textual sources by promoting a flexible,
   networked approach to e-infrastructure development. Crucially, Asia
   Network is a loosely-coupled software with flexible topologies; it can
   enable both federated or centralized linkages, and it can even
   "disappear" as long as its API standards remain in place to facilitate
   communications among databases and tools in the back-end. Thus, unlike
   large- scale infrastructural projects, Asia Network actively lowers the
   profile of centralized infrastructure and instead promotes existing
   tools and resources by enabling their interoperability. As a result, it
   allows scholars to fully leverage the potential of material digitization
   and digital research tools without re-creating silos of resources in the
   digital realm.

   power relation can be characterised as a power asymmetry, with scholars
   dependent on the developers of infrastructures. In order to reduce this
   power asymmetry, infrastructures are developed in collaboration between
   scholars and computational researchers. Through an analysis of 28
   interviews of eScience projects in digital history I have investigated
   whether collaborations succeed in reducing power asymmetry. In this
   paper I will explore knowledge asymmetry, the ignorance of how a
   collaborator performs their tasks, and how this reinforces power
   asymmetry. I will moreover consider how these asymmetries pose a
   challenge in the development and adoption of research infrastructures in
   the humanities.

AB The world of digital humanities is not something to explain and
   understand in theory.The right approach to the world can only be
   achieved when practical efforts are made to find useful knowledge in
   creating and processing the humanities data. It may also be a more
   important task to ensure that our future generations have the research
   capabilities that future humanities require rather than we are trying to
   pursue the interest of contemporary researchers. From this point of
   view, I have discussed what questions the college’s digital humanities
   education should begin with and what specific ways to take its first
   step.I have established the view that digital humanities education for
   future generations should start with teaching them how to explore
   humanities knowledge through communication and collaboration, and
   proposed the following stepwise implementation process.The first step is
   to set up ‘online server systems’ where the students can publish their
   own digital contents and communicate with each other with their
   contributions. The second is to educate them to create collaborative
   data in digital environments such as Wiki. At first, the data will take
   the form of human reading, but the next step is to be able to create
   explicit data that can also be read by a computer. By doing so,
   computers should be our collaborators investigating meaningful
   humanities knowledge. This series of tasks is the basic educational
   challenge that should be pursued at the practical site of digital
   humanities education.
AK 최근 수년 사이 한국의 인문학 연구자들 사이에서도 디지털 인문학에 대한 관심이높아지고 있고, 디지털적 방법으로 인문학 연구를
   수행하려는 시도가 확산되어 가고있다. 그러나 디지털 인문학이 무엇이며, 그것이 현대의 인문학 활동에 왜 필요한지를 논하는 원론적
   논의에서 한 걸음 더 나아가 그것을 우리의 교육ㆍ연구의 현장에서실천하는 과제에 대해서는 여전히 많은 사람들이 ‘쉽지 않은 일’로
   생각하며, 그길에 들어서기를 주저하고 있는 것이 현실이다.디지털 인문학의 세계는 이론으로 설명하고 이해하면 되는 대상이 아니다.
   데이터를 만들고 그것과 씨름하는 가운데 유용한 지식을 찾아가는 실천적인 노력이 전제될때에만 그 세계에 대한 올바른 접근이 이루어질
   수 있다. 또한 디지털 환경에 익숙하지 않은 기성세대가 당장 그 과실을 얻으려 하기보다는 미래의 인문학을 이끌어갈우리의 후학들이
   미래의 인문학이 요구하는 연구 역량을 갖출 수 있도록 하는 것이이 분야에서 더 중요한 과제이다.필자는, 미래 세대를 위한 디지털
   인문학 교육은 소통과 협업에 의한 인문학 지식탐구의 방법을 알려 주는 것에서부터 출발해야 한다는 관점을 세우고, 다음과 같은단계적
   수행 절차를 제안하였다.그 첫 번째는 ‘서버’ 운영을 통해 학생들이 그들의 저작물을 가지고 세계와 소통할수 있는 무대를 마련하는
   것이고, 두 번째는 ‘위키’와 같은 디지털 환경에서 협업가능한 데이터를 만드는 교육을 시행하는 것이다. 처음에는 그 데이터가
   인간이읽는 글의 형식을 취하겠지만, 그 다음 단계에서는 컴퓨터도 읽을 수 있는 명시적데이터를 만들 수 있어야 한다. 그렇게
   함으로써 컴퓨터가 우리 지식의 외연을 넓히고 엄밀성을 강화하는 협업의 동반자가 될 수 있게 하는 일련의 일들이 ‘디지털 인문학
   교육의 현장’에서 단계적으로 이루어져야 할 교육 과제이다.

AB Digital literary studies in the United States has developed in the form
   of computational text analysis since the 1960s. At first it was not
   properly appreciated by mainstream academia, but it began to draw public
   attention largely due to the rise of digital humanities discourse along
   with the rapid progress of digital technology at the turn of the
   century. English studies was one of the major disciplines that actively
   adopted digital humanistic methodology and applied it to research and
   education. Digital literary scholars have shed light on previously
   unknown aspects of English literature by combining text analysis and
   “distant reading” and by statistically analyzing large-scale corpora of
   literary works. They take advantage of such sophisticated methods as
   metadata analysis, social network analysis and visualization, topic
   modeling, machine learning, and geographic information system as well as
   traditional text analysis techniques. In contrast, Korean academics of
   English literature are completely indifferent to digital literary
   studies. Ignoring any new methodology to study literature cannot be
   justified at all. Someone should try it, and we should debate about its
   value and validity. This will surely enrich Korean academia. This paper
   examines major research achievements of American digital literary
   studies from the early years of humanities computing to the present,
   thus laying the groundwork for discussion on digital humanistic
   approaches to English literature in Korea.
AK 미국 영문학계에서 디지털인문학적 방법론을 활용한 영미문학 연구는 비록 주 류 학계의 인정이나 주목을 받지는 못했지만
   1960년대부터 꾸준히 전산적 텍스트 분석의 전통을 이어왔다. 디지털 영문학 연구는 새 세기에 접어들면서 디지털 기술 의 급속한
   진보와 함께 디지털인문학 담론의 부상으로 새롭게 각광을 받기 시작했 다. 이에 따라 영문학계는 디지털인문학적인 방법론을 가장
   적극적으로 받아들이면 서 이를 연구와 교육에 활발하게 적용하고 있다. 특히 미국의 디지털 영문학 연구 는 텍스트 분석의 전통과
   멀리서 읽기의 전통이 화학적으로 결합하면서 수많은 문 학 텍스트로 이루어진 거대 말뭉치의 통계적 분석으로 나아가 그동안 학술적
   시야 에 들어오지 않던 영미문학의 새로운 측면들을 밝혀주는 성과를 내고 있다. 분석 기법도 다양해져서 전통적인 텍스트 분석 기법에
   더해 메타 데이터 분석, 사회 관 계망 분석 및 시각화, 토픽 모델링, 기계 학습, 지리정보 분석 등으로 한층 정교화 되고 있다.
   이와는 대조적으로 디지털인문학에 대한 한국 영문학계의 태도는 완전 한 무관심과 철저한 외면에 가깝다. 문학을 연구하는 새로운
   방법론이 있는데 이를 외면하는 것은 어떤 식으로든 정당화될 수 없다. 누군가는 시도해야 하고 그것의 가치와 타당성에 대해 논쟁해야
   한다. 이는 분명 한국 영문학계를 풍성하게 할 것 이다. 본고는 인문전산학적인 초기 단계부터 2000년대 이후 지금까지 미국
   디지털 영문학의 대표적인 연구 성과들을 검토함으로써 한국 영문학계에서 디지털인문학 적인 접근 방식에 대한 논의가 활성화될 수 있는
   초석을 닦는다.

   researchers exploring digitised historical documents. The tool
   visualises keyword instances in context mapped by date, and can be used
   to explore commentary around themes through time. Through designing the
   tool and evaluating it with humanities scholars, the role of the
   designer in the digital humanities is explored. Interview evaluation
   with historians provides evidence for the tool's capacity to support
   historical research, but also raises design issues by pointing to the
   value of simple, minimal design in this domain for interpretability.

   being conduced in Taiwan, and the trend of Digital Humanities
   research.In Great China Region such as China, Taiwan, etc.,
   digitalization work of Chinese characters and Chinese classics is being
   positively carried out. That is, not only do the countries digitalize
   materials related to Chinese classics and Chinese characters in a large
   scale, but also they are introducing computational linguistics sand
   digital humanities research methods for studying. To understanding a
   study trend of such Great Chinese countries may have implications in
   digitalizing and utilizing Chinese classics materials in Korea, and also
   may give contribute to seek a new methodology of studying Chinese
   classics in Korea.According to such necessity, this paper, focusing on
   Taiwan among Great Chineses countries, examined the situation of Chinese
   classics digitalization conducted by them, and utilization of study
   methods of digital humanities, etc. First of all, the reason I looked
   into the case of Taiwan is that the results of digitalization of Chinese
   classics conducted in Taiwan is excellent, and also Taiwan performs
   researches on Chinese classics by positively introducing digital
   humanities.
AK 본고는 臺灣의 漢文古典 관련 자료의 전산화 현황 및 數位人文學(디지털인문학) 연구 동향을 검토하는 것을 목표로 한다.漢字를 자국의
   문자로 사용하고 있는 중국과 대만 등 中華圈 국가에서는 한자와 한문고전 자료의 전산화 작업을 적극적으로 진행하고 있다. 즉 대량의
   한자학 및 한문고전 관련 자료를 전산화하여 컴퓨터와 인터넷을 통해 활용할 수 있게 할 뿐 아니라, 전산언어학 및 디지털인문학의
   연구 방법을 도입하여 한문고전에 대한 연구를 진행하고 있다. 이처럼 중화권 국가에서 진행하고 있는 한문고전 전산화의 성과,
   디지털인문학 연구의 동향, 이에 대한 평가와 전망 등에 대해 살펴보는 것은 한국에서 한문고전 자료를 전산화하고 이를 활용하는
   방안을 모색하는 데에 시사점을 얻을 수 있을 뿐 아니라 한국 한문학 연구의 새로운 방법론을 시도하는 데에도 일정한 도움을 줄 수
   있다.이러한 필요성에 따라, 본고에서는 중화권 국가 중에서 우선 대만의 경우에 한정하여 이들이 수행한 한문고전 전산화의 현황,
   그리고 디지털인문학 연구의 동향 등에 대해 살펴보았다. 우선 대만의 경우를 먼저 살펴본 것은 대만에서 진행한 한문고전 전산화의
   성과가 우수하며 또한 디지털인문학 연구 방법을 적극적으로 도입하여 한문고전 연구를 진행하고 있다고 평가받기 때문이다.

AB As debates in the digital humanities has continued to grow largely
   across the world since the mid 2000s, there also has been a growing
   interest in the digital humanities in Korea. In spite of the growing
   interest in the digital humanities, it is disappointing that few
   researches have been done in Korea. Recently, there has been a lot of
   discourse about the concept of 'digital humanities' in Korea, but the
   fact that discussions on what is the specific methodology of digital
   humanities research have not been active is deeply related to this
   realistic situation. In fact, digital humanities in Korea is still at an
   early stage. Therefore, in order to have a complete understanding of
   digital humanities and to avoid embracing imprudent opinions, we have to
   approach cautiously so as to remove abstractness from discussions on
   digital humanities. With this as consideration, it is necessary to
   epitomize humanities researches in Korea that uses digital platforms in
   earnest. There are nine cases of digital humanities researches in this
   paper. Though each case has its own object that distinguishes one case
   from another cases, digital platforms that they are based on are very
   similar to one another's. Web Ontology Language, Network Graph
   Visualization and Media WikiTM are the examples. It's likely that
   scholars and researchers who want to study digital humanities can reach
   a better understanding by reading the cases presented in this paper.
AK 2,000년대 중후반 이후로 디지털 인문학에 대한 논의가 전 세계적으로 꾸준히 확산됨에 따라 국내에서도 디지털 인문학에 대한
   관심이 점차로 증가하고 있는 상황이다. 아쉬운 점은 디지털 인문학에 대한 관심이 증가하고 있는 것과 별개로, 실제 국내에서
   이루어졌거나 또는 이루어지고 있는 디지털 인문학 연구 사례가 매우 적다는 사실이다. 최근 국내에서 ‘디지털 인문학’이라는 개념에
   대한 담론은 많이 형성되고 있지만, 상대적으로 디지털 인문학 연구의 구체적 방법론이 무엇인지 그 실제(實際)에 대한 논의가 좀처럼
   이루어지지 않고 있는 것은, 바로 이러한 현실적 상황과 관련이 깊다.특히 고전 자료 또는 고문헌 자료를 대상으로 한 인문학 연구의
   경우, 텍스트로부터 데이터를 풍부하게 추출할 수 있다는 측면에서 디지털 인문학 연구 방법론을 활용할 수 있는 여지가 매우 크다.
   그럼에도 불구하고 고문헌 자료를 대상으로 하여 국내에서 진행되었거나 또는 진행되고 있는 디지털 인문학 연구 사례 또한 찾아보기가
   어려운 현실이다. 이와 같은 맥락에서 고문헌 자료를 대상으로 하여 디지털 미디어를 본격적으로 활용한 국내의 연구 사례들이
   구체적으로 무엇인지 그리고 각각의 연구가 안고 있는 학술적 맥락이 무엇인지 정리해볼 필요가 있다.당장 고문헌 자료를 대상으로
   디지털 인문학 연구를 수행하고자 하는 연구자들에게 가장 훌륭한 참고 요소가 될 수 있는 것은, 기존 연구 사례가 무엇인지에 대한
   소개와 개별 사례에 대한 귀납적 검토이다. 각각의 연구가 이루어질 수 있었던 기초적 문제의식과 연구 과정에 적용된 디지털 기술
   그리고 구현된 결과물이 갖추고 있는 디지털 형식의 의미가 무엇인지 개략적으로 파악된다면, 고문헌 자료를 대상으로 디지털 인문학
   연구를 시도하고자 하는 연구자들에게 매우 훌륭한 참고 요소가 될 것이다.실제로 본고에서 정리한 9가지 국내 디지털 인문학 연구
   사례는 각각이 다른 형식의 고문헌 자료를 대상으로 하면서도 유사한 디지털 플랫폼을 활용하였거나 또는 데이터를 체계적으로 정리하기
   위한 온톨로지를 공통적으로 적용하는 등 디지털 인문학 방법론의 차원에서 비교․대조하여 참고할만한 지점이 매우 많다.

AB Digital humanities are forming a big trend. In the United States and
   France and overseas, the Digital Humanities Support Policy is being
   implemented to activate digital humanities such as building
   infrastructures. In Korea, the policies are somewhat inferior to the
   various activities of digital humanities. Although there is a project to
   support digital humanities, the digital humanities policy in Korea is
   set as a part of the humanities promotion policy. In the sense that the
   humanities promotion policy is a policy response to the social
   atmosphere that is the crisis of the humanities, the digital humanities
   support project is also in that context. In other words, digital
   humanities are recognized as an effective way of proving the social
   utility of humanities rather than approaching new research trends. In
   order for the digital humanities in Korea to evolve further, it is
   necessary to expand the discourse on digital humanities and establish
   more active policies. In order to establish the digital humanities
   policy, it is necessary to raise the policy status of digital
   humanities, to map digital humanities, to diversify support projects, to
   reconceptualize the digital humanities infrastructure, and to secure
   separate organizations and resources.
AK 국내외에서 디지털인문학은 하나의 큰 흐름을 형성하고 있다. 미국과 프랑스 등해외에서는 인프라 구축 등 디지털인문학 활성화를 위한
   디지털인문학 지원 정책을시행하고 있다. 국내에서는 디지털인문학의 다양한 활동에 비해 정책은 다소 미흡하다. 디지털인문학에 대한
   지원 사업은 있지만, 해외에서는 디지털인문학을 별도의정책 영역으로 설정되어 있는 것과 달리 국내 디지털인문학 정책은 인문학
   진흥정책의 일환으로 설정되어 있다. 인문학 진흥 정책이 인문학의 위기라는 사회적분위기에 대한 정책적 대응이라는 점에서 디지털인문학
   지원 사업도 그 맥락 하에있다고 하겠다. 즉 디지털인문학을 새로운 연구 경향으로 접근하기 보다는 인문학의사회적 효용성을 증명하는
   효과적인 방법으로 인식하는 것이다. 국내 디지털인문학이 한층 더 진화하기 위해서 디지털인문학에 대한 담론 확대와 함께 보다
   적극적인정책 수립이 요구된다. 디지털인문학 정책의 수립을 위해서 디지털인문학의 정책적위상 제고, 디지털인문학의 매핑, 지원 사업의
   다양화, 디지털인문학 인프라의 재개념화, 별도의 조직과 재원의 확보 등이 필요하다.

AB Rapid progression into a digital society in the 21st century has meant
   that the center of discourses regarding future education has shifted
   towards digital literacy and capabilities. Indeed, the strong preference
   shown by Generation Z toward new media indicates the emergence of
   completely different ways of social interactions and communication than
   ever before.This study proposes ‘Arts with Humanities in Education' as
   one of the arts education discourses with the capacity to efficiently
   contribute to the development of literacy and relevant capabilities for
   a digital era. The notion of ‘Arts with Humanities in Education'
   inherits and furthers the discourse of Martha C. Nussbaum, who
   emphasizes the liberal arts education as a crucial part of future
   education. Following on from this, this study argues ‘Arts with
   Humanities in Education' aims toward the realization of “imagination of
   praxis” through the signification of arts activities that are
   characterized by dialogic aesthetic experiences.On the basis of the
   theoretical analysis toward new directions for arts education in a
   digital era, this study reviews an exemplary of “Arts Together,” a
   program that has been organized and successfully implemented in 2018 by
   SFAC(Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture) as part of the regular
   school curriculum across 103 middle schools in Seoul, and explores the
   possibility of ‘Arts with Humanities in Education' as a new practice of
   arts education in school.
AK 21세기 디지털 사회 진입이 가속화하면서 미래교육의 중심 담론이 디지털 리터러시 및 핵심역량 교육으로 향하고 있다. 특히 현재
   디지털 Z세대로 불리는 어린이ㆍ청소년 세대의 뉴미디어 선호는 지금까지와는 완전히 다른 사회적 상호작용과 소통방식을 예고하고 있어
   디지털 환경에서 필요한 리터러시 이해에 기초하여 교육적 접근이 달라져야 할 것으로 보인다. 본 연구는 디지털 시대에 필요한
   예술교육 담론의 하나로서 ‘인문예술교육’을 제안하고자 한다. ‘인문예술교육’은 미래교육의 핵심으로 인문학과 예술교육을 강조한
   Martha C. Nussbaum의 인문교양교육 논의를 발전적으로 계승하고, ‘대화적 미적체험’을 특징으로 하는 예술 활동의
   언어화 및 의미화를 통해 ‘실천적 상상력’을 실현하는 것을 목표로 한다. 디지털 시대 인문예술교육의 방향에 대한 이론적 논의를
   바탕으로 학교교육과정 내 인문예술교육 적용 가능성을 확인하기 위해 2018년 서울 103개 중학교 정규교육과정에서 실행되고 있는
   서울문화재단 청소년 인문예술교육 지원사업 <예술로 함께> 프로그램 운영 사례를 참고자료로서 제시하였다. 이를 통해 디지털 시대

AB Klaus Schwab, the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum,

   Schwab argues that the size, speed and scope of these historic changes
   were brought up by the “unlimited possibilities” of connectivity by
   mobile devices and the convergent “emerging technology breakthroughs,”
   Structured data in the digital humanities has been given “the explicit
   formal properties” based upon the “secondary organizing principle” of
   encoding. Since the 1960’s, computer processing of textual data in
   textual and literary field has expanded enormously in intersection with
   digital technology in the forms of electronic texts.In this context, we
   humanists encounter the vortex of inbound authenticity and outbound
   hybridization in the big data of the literatures and cultures of the
   world. This dynamic vortex when gathered and seen from the perspective
   of the structured data will construct the translational space of world
   literature. The objective of this paper is to view distantly some

AB This article is part of a joint research project organized for
   investigating how the Digital Humanities are affecting historical
   studies in various countries and fields. I focus on eighteenth-century
   French history, the Enlightenment and the French Revolution in
   particular, to look into the new attempts to adapt the digital
   approaches to historical inquiries. In case of the Enlightenment, there
   have appeared many digital projects for illuminating the structure of
   the “Republic of Letters” and the history of books in a new frame. It is
   made possible because many historical sources have been already
   digitized by the prior projects of intellectual and literary history. In
   contrast, as a majority of the sources of the French Revolution have not
   been digitized, a variety of transnational efforts for constructing
   digital archives of the French Revolution are being under process. As a
   result, new digital history revamps the prior frames of historical
   studies, stimulates many discussions about historical methodology and
   facilitates the transnational turn by expanding digital archives.
   However, it should be warned that the power-knowledge structure
   inscribed in existing sources and archives can be reproduced here in a
   more extreme manner. I conclude that we need to prepare for a new turn
   by contemplating the meaning of this change within a longer history of
   historiography.
AK 이 연구는 소위 ‘제4차 산업혁명’의 도래와 함께 현재 학계에서 화제를 불러일으키고 있는 디지털인문학의 전세계적 현황을 조망하려는
   공동연구의 일부이다. 여기서 필자는 전공 분야인 18세기 프랑스사를 중심으로 디지털인문학적 시도들을 구체적으로 살펴보되,
   디지털인문학이 기존의 18세기사 연구에 어떠한 파장을 일으키고 있는지 평가하고 이를 통해 사학사적 맥락 내에서 디지털인문학의
   의미를 고찰하고자 했다. 이를 위해18세기 프랑스사의 핵심이자 서로 연결된 주제인 계몽주의 연구와 혁명사로 나누어 여기서
   디지털인문학적 시도들의 계보와 연구 성과들을 조망했다. 계몽주의 연구의 경우 이전의 문학사와 지성사 작업의 결과 주요 텍스트들이
   이미 디지털화되어 있어서 그 위에서 18세기 ‘문필공화국’의 양상과 책의 역사를 새롭게 조명하기 위한 시도들이 출현하고 있다.
   프랑스혁명사의 경우에는 아직 많은 사료가 디지털화되어 있지 않아 디지털문서고의 형성을 중심으로 국제적 협업들이 진행되고 있으며,
   이와 함께 디지털 시대의 새로운 관점으로 혁명의 시대를 재해석하려는 연구들 역시 나타나고 있다. 그 결과 디지털인문학은 과거의
   연구들을 새롭게 조망하고 디지털문서고를 통한 초국가적 전환을 더욱 촉진하고 있다. 그러나 문서고 속에 아로새겨진 권력의 작용이
   디지털화 작업 속에서 더 극적으로 재생산될 가능성 역시 경계해야 한다. 결론적으로 필자는 디지털 시대의 도래가 역사학에 급격한
   단절을 가져올 것이라고 성급히 가정하기보다 이를 역사학의 장기적 변화 과정 속에서 조망하며 새로운 전환을 준비할 것을 제안한다.

AB Since 2011, there has been a collective academic trend called Digital
   Humanities in Taiwan. The foundation was the task of building a digital
   archive of historical literature and the sense of problem. Digital
   Humanities was a stepping stone to academic questions and practices in
   applying information science technology to humanities research. The
   scholars of Digital in Taiwan have created a new method of learning by
   developing and using tools to read and analyze massive amounts of
   digital archive in such a way.This method is to read and analyze digital
   data in digital rather than analog.“The international conference of
   Digital Archive & Digital Humanities” (DADH) started to held in 2009,
   the organization of digital humanities was strengthened and the Taiwan
   Association Digital Humanities was officially launched in 2016. Through
   this process, digital liberal arts has become a new territory and the
   term ‘DHer(Digital Humanities Scholar)’ has also been coined. Taiwan's
   digital humanities will further evolve after developing data, developing
   systems, and improving areas. After several years of preparation and
   experimentation, it is going to provide a solution called ‘DocuSky’ that
   will build a database and analysis system that will meet the research
   needs of individual researchers. Based on this evolved environment,
   Taiwan's Digital Humanities will move forward to a new level by
   accelerating expansion and growth.

   발로였다. 대만의 디지털인문학자들은 이러한 문제의식에서 방대한 디지털아카이브를 독해하고 분석하는 도구를 개발, 활용하면서 새로운
   학문방법을 창출했다. 이 방법은 디지털자료를 아날로그식이 아닌 디지털방식으로 독해하고 분석하는 방법이다. 2009년부터 대규모
   디지털인문학 국제학술회의가 개최되면서 디지털인문학자의 조직력은 강화되고 2016년에 대만 디지털인문학회가 정식으로 출범했다.
   이러한 과정을 거쳐 디지털인문학은 새로운 영역으로 정착하고 특정 학문분야에 국한되지 않은 ‘디지털인문학자(DHer)’라는 용어도
   탄생했다. 데이터, 시스템, 영역개척을 거쳐 대만 디지털인문학은 한층 진화한다. 대만대학 디지털인문학 수년의 준비와 실험을 거쳐
   개별연구자의 연구 수요에 맞는 데이터베이스와 분석시스템을 구축할 솔류선을 제공하기에 이른다. 이로써 자료구축, 독해, 분석을
   연구자가 직접 디지털식으로 수행하는 환경이 구축되었다. 이러한 진화된 환경을 토대로 대만의 디지털인문학은 확장과 성장을 가속화할
   것으로 전망된다.

   Korean culinary history and culture to extend current notions of the
   digital humanities. A survey of the relevant literature shows that while
   technical advances in the digital humanities have been strong, digital
   contents lack a humanistic approach. Using the humanities to enrich a
   technological base would help digital users to explore educational
   materials in a more humanistic and ethical fashion. An exemplary
   educational model of teaching language and content is suggested as a way
   to emphasize this perspective of the humanities. From the humanistic
   viewpoints, digital users can develop their critical awareness such that
   they can expand their thoughts to consider the well-being of persons,
   thus perceiving teaching contents from multiple perspectives. The
   educational implications of this approach are discussed.

AB This paper discusses the characteristics of Digital Humanities and the
   ways of improving our participation in the field of Digital Humanities.
   I am a digital humanities scholar as well as a literary researcher: I
   work on the computer most of time while I research on Korean literature.
   Even if most humanities scholars rely on the computer devices and their
   system when they conduct a research project or write academic papers,
   they do not realize that their research activities fall into the
   category of Digital Humanities.Digital humanities is not about using
   digital tools as a means to reconstruct our knowledge, but it is an
   effort to build new academic communities that transcend boundaries
   between different academic fields through the trans-disciplinary
   perspective. Therefore, Digital Humanities can be defined as a concept
   that refers to a series of academic activities, such as research
   activities in Humanities and its education, in the new way by applying
   the computer (information) technology to the problems of the humanities
   field, and the most important thing in this process is the consilience
   and collaboration of digital and humanities.The digital environment has
   the advantage of enhancing the sense of immersion and the vicarious
   experience of the user, but it has the disadvantage that there is a
   small room for the reader's imagination. The sense of immersion and joy
   the users experience in the digital environment are not a direct
   experience of the reality but a vicarious experience (agency) in the
   virtual reality. It is different from the term substitute behavior
   because the user is participating in the internet game, and it is also
   different from the direct experience because the game is built in the
   virtual space. The problem that digital game users who are deeply
   involved in the game that offers the sense of full immersion and
   vicarious experience (agency) show the anti-social behaviors in the real
   world should be addressed.Humanities scholars who are doing the creative
   and productive works must be the main body of consilience and
   collaboration of Digital Humanities. Human imagination is more valuable
   than the sensation we experience when we look at the shocking images
   produced by ever-evolving computer technology. It is hard to disagree
   that humanities are the crucial academic field that can enhance human
   imagination.
AK 이 글은 디지털 인문학의 특질과 앞으로의 대응 방향을 모색하기 위해 쓴다. 나는 국문학 연구가로서 컴퓨터로 많은 작업을 하는
   디지털 인문학자다. 대부분의 인문학자들이 컴퓨터 기기 및 시스템에 의존해 연구하고 글을 쓰면서도 자신의 연구 활동이 디지털
   인문학의 범주에 속한다는 사실을 인지하지 못한다.디지털인문학은 단순히 디지털 도구를 학문과 지식의 재구성을 위해 동원하는 수단이
   아니라 초학제적(transdisciplinary)으로 경계를 넘나드는 새로운 학문 공동체를 구성하려는 노력이다. 그러므로
   디지털인문학은 컴퓨터(정보) 기술을 인문학 분야의 문제에 적용시켜 새로운 방식으로 인문학 연구와 교육 등 일련의 학문적 활동을
   지칭하는 개념으로 정의할 수 있고, 이 과정에서 가장 중요한 것은 디지털과 인문학의 융합과 협업이다. 디지털 환경은 체험자의
   몰입(immersion)과 대리체험(agency)이 가능한 장점이 있지만, 독서할 때의 자유로운 상상(imagination)이
   방해받는 단점이 있다. 디지털 환경에서의 몰입과 즐거움은 현실의 직접 체험이 아니라 가상현실에서의 대리체험이며, 그것은 이용자가
   인터넷 게임에 참여하는 형식이어서 대리만족(대상행동, substitute behavior)과 구별되는 것 같지만, 게임 공간이
   실제 현실이 아니라 가상현실이라는 점에서 직접체험과 다르다. 디지털 게임 이용자가 게임에 깊이 빠져들수록 현실부적응 행태를 보이는
   것은 가상체험의 몰입, 대리체험이 해결해야 할 숙제다.인문학자가 디지털 인문학의 융합․협업의 주체가 되어야 생산적이고 창의적인
   새로운 작업이 가능하다. 갈수록 진화하는 컴퓨터 기술이 재현할 시각적 이미지의 화려한 충격보다 중요한 것은 인간의 ‘상상력’을
   저하시키기 않는 일이다. 인문학이 인간의 상상력을 증진시킬 수 있는 유력한 학문분야라는 점은 아무리 강조해도 지나치지 않다.

AB This paper stemmed from a realization that musicology should consider in
   depth the methodology that is pursued in “Digital Humanities,” including
   the digitalization of primary sources, and Linked Data that syncs
   information about these sources through the Semantic Web. With the
   current emphasis on the 4th industrial revolution, humanities and
   musicology as a field of study based on humanities, is faced with a
   challenge of developing creative contents by developing, combining and
   applying digital technology with clear methodology in an environment of
   digital technology. Although it is important to construct music-specific
   databases and archives based on detailed musical considerations, new
   branches of musicology should be established, including the technology
   to read and analyze the linked data in the digitization of musical
   information and newly expand the scope and subject of research, and to
   extract contents linked by context. This paper introduces the history of
   digital musicology, which is not well known to Korean music academics,
   and the techniques and operations used in digital musicology.
   Ultimately, this study is meaningful in that it is a foundational study
   necessary for the fostering of new age musicologists who are skilled in
   computer language and will develop new fields of music research through
   the development and operation of music related digital programs.

AB This paper critically examines the short but remarkable history of the
   digital humanities in Korea, and reveals its achievements, limitations,
   and realities by comparing it with the digital humanities in the West,
   especially in the United States. Digital humanities is not simply a
   combination of humanistic knowledge with digital technology. It emerged
   as an attempt to revive the creative relevance of the humanities with
   digital technology and to transform the digital civilization with
   humanistic values, facing the unprecedented crisis of the established
   institutional humanities. It is basically a non-commercial,
   anti-authoritarian humanistic practice that cherishes the values of
   openness, collaboration, autonomy, and creativity. The digital
   humanities in Korea is still in a germinal stage and yet evolving with
   distinctively unique characteristics. One salient feature is that
   discussion on digital humanities is largely confined to the so-called
   “humanistic contents” and thus inevitably intertwined with the
   commercial logic of the culture industry. Korean digital humanities is
   likely to be subjected to the commercial interests and political demands
   of the culture industry. This will intensify the crisis of the
   humanities rather than revitalize the humanistic values. Digital
   humanities should be more faithful to the spirits of open source and
   creative commons to advocate and refashion the humanities as the
   discipline of hope and sustainability.
AK 본 논문은 한국에서 이루어지고 있는 디지털인문학에 관한 논의를 서구, 특히 영미 학계와의 비교를 통해 비판적으로 검토하면서 그
   성과와 한계, 현실을 점검하고, 과제와 대안을 제시하고자 한다. 디지털인문학은 단순히 인문지식을 디지털 기술과 접목하는 데
   머물기보다는 디지털 기술로 인문학의 창조성과 현실성을 부활하고, 인문학 정신으로 디지털 문명을 변화시키려는 시도로서 기존 인문학의
   대안으로 등장하였다. 그것은 본질적으로 공유와 협업, 자율과 창의를 핵심으로 하는 비상업적, 반독점적, 탈권위적 인문 실천이다.
   한국의 디지털인문학은 여전히 맹아적 단계에 있긴 하지만 매우 독특한 특징을 띤 채 전개되고 있다. 특히 두드러진 특징은
   디지털인문학에 관한 논의가 주로 인문콘텐츠라는 한국적인 담론틀 안에서 이루어져 문화산업의 상업적 논리에서 벗어나지 못한다는
   점이다. 이는 한국의 디지털인문학이 공유와 자율의 정신에 충실하기보다는 상업적 이익과 문화 권력의 요구에 종속되는 상황으로 이어질
   가능성을 높이고 있다. 이는 인문학을 회생하기보다는 그 위기를 더욱 강화하는 결과로 이어질 것이다. 인문학이 희망과 지속가능성의
   학문으로 재탄생하기 위해서는 한국의 디지털인문학은 개방과 공유 정신에 보다 충실해야 한다.

AK 디지털 인문학 연구는 유럽과 북미에서 시작되어 한국, 일본, 중국, 대만을 비롯한 아시아에서도 활발하게 수행되고 있으며, 연구의
   주제는 인문학, 지역학, 역사학 등 다양한 분야에서 텍스트, 이미지, 멀티미디어, 다이어그램 및 네트워크 연결망 등의 자료를
   활용하고 있다. 일본의 문화와 역사에서 중요한 부분을 차지하고 있는 해양문명과 관련된 주제는 기존의 텍스트와 이미지를 바탕으로 한
   인문지식이 많이 축척이 되어 있지만 그 형태가 그림, 텍스트, 지도 등으로 일정하지 않고 분산되어 있어 이용하는데 어려움이 있을
   수 있다. 따라서 기존의 해양문명과 관련된 인문지식의 효율적인 활용을 위해 디지털 인문학 방법론을 적용한 연구는 의미가 있을
   것이라 보여 진다.

AB This paper investigates the establishment and significance of digital
   humanities in the age of cultural industry. In a time when culture has
   become both industry and capital, the humanities should also adapt to
   the new environment. ‘Digital humanities,’ as a new field of academics,
   could broaden the boundaries of the humanities by using the information
   of the discipline with the ‘digital’ tools. Digital humanities can have
   specific applications to various fields. ‘Digital Area Studies’ could be
   one example. The digitalization of collecting and systemizing
   information and knowledge about one specific area could bring history
   and culture to life. This could help us understand issues in three
   dimensions, using not only historical literature, but also photos,
   videos, sounds, etc.To fully embrace the digital humanities requires
   creative, talented people with knowledge of culture and liberal arts, as
   well as an understanding of digital media. Expertise in related fields,
   new perspectives and methodologies and insights for the next generation
   are also needed. To educate talented individuals in liberal arts,
   engineering competency, we must develop cultural contents, various forms
   of media, and a curriculum of both practice and field works. ‘Digital
   humanities’ is a new field and represents the modernization of the
   liberal arts tradition by enabling liberal arts to make use of practical
   future resources. Digital humanities is a meaningful and important
   discipline in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
AK 이 논문은 문화산업 시대에 디지털 인문학이 어떤 위상과 의미를 가질 수 있는지에 대해서 논의하고 있다. 문화가 산업이 되고 자본이
   되는 시대에 맞추어인문학 역시 새로운 환경에 적응해가야 할 것이다. 새로운 학문 영역으로서의‘디지털 인문학’은 인문학 정보를
   ‘디지털’이라는 방법론과 도구를 활용하여 인문학의 지평을 넓히는데 기여할 수 있다.나아가 디지털 인문학은 다양한 영역에서
   구체적으로 적용될 수 있을 것이다. 예컨대 ‘디지털 지역학’을 들 수 있을 것이다. 어느 한 지역에 관한 정보와지식을 수집,
   체계화해서 디지털화하는 작업은 그 지역의 역사와 문화를 생생하게 살아있는 것으로 만들어줄 것이다. 문헌뿐만 아니라 사진, 영상,
   음향 등다양한 자료를 통해서 그 지역을 입체적으로 이해할 수 있게 해주기 때문이다.디지털 인문학이 제대로 자리 잡기 위해서는
   인문학적 소양과 디지털 매체에 대한 이해, 그리고 문화콘텐츠 관련 지식을 갖춘 창의적인 인재가 뒷받침되어야 한다. 관련된 인접
   학문에 대한 이해와 새로운 시각과 방법론, 다가오는시대에 대한 통찰이 필요하다. 인문학적 소양과 공학적 소양을 겸비한 융복합인재를
   양성하기 위해서는 문화콘텐츠, 다양한 매체, 실습과 현장 교육 등을갖춘 커리큘럼 개발되어야 할 것이다.디지털 인문학은 오랜
   인문학적인 전통의 현대화, 나아가서는 그 인문학적인 전통을 미래의 유용한 자원으로 활용할 수 있는 인문학의 새로운 영역이다.디지털
   인문학은 제4차 산업혁명시대에도 충분한 의미를 지닐 수 있을 것이다.

AB The year 2002 is estimated as the beginning of ‘Digital Era’ when
   digital data began to exceed analog ones in term of production quantity.
   Since then, digital data increases exponentially. Efficient and
   effective analysis of such ‘big data’ becomes more and more important,
   and a variety of research fields undergo a paradigm shift in approaches.
   Informatics provides researchers with numerous tools analyzing their big
   data. Humanities, of which research texts constitute ‘long data’ (i.e.
   tiny quantity during very long periods) written on papers (i.e. in
   analog format), seemed to stand out of such changes. ‘Google Books
   Project’, which aims to transform all books ever published into
   digitalized format, is significant in Humanities, in a sense that
   meaningful but unseen facts can be found through processing digitalized
   long data.The ‘Center for the Study of Humanities Informatics’
   (hereafter, CSHI) at Pusan National University has been investigating
   the first era of modernity in Korea (from the mid 19th to the early 20th
   centuries) with other fields of Humanities. The Korean bilingual
   dictionaries formulated in that period by Western missionaries or
   diplomats were one of important research materials. Elaborate
   observations had not been conducted due to language barriers and the
   micro-structure of those dictionaries. Informatics could help us to open
   those hidden archives and to find unseen facts: CSHI digitalized six 
   Korean bilingual dictionaries, transformed three of them into
   knowledgebases, and opened them to the public on the web. The
   digitalized versions provided by CSHI are now used as concrete and
   reliable resources not only by CSHI’s affiliates but also other Korean
   scholars. However, CSHI’s works are far from being sufficient: much more
   texts in that period need to be digitalized. We suggest ‘Cloud
   Digitalization’: a large number of Korean Humanities scholars will join
   in digitalizing their concerned texts and in sharing them.
AK 2002년은 이른바 ‘디지털 시대’가 열린 해로 평가된다. 생산량에서 디지털 데이터가 아날로그 데이터를 앞선 해이다. 그 이후로
   디지털 데이터는 기하급수적으로 증가하고 있다. 따라서 이러한 ‘빅데이터’에 대한 능률적이고 효과적인 분석은 점점 중요해지고, 그
   결과 다양한 연구 분야에서 패러다임의 변환을 겪을 것으로 예상한다. 정보학은 연구자들에게 그들의 빅데이터를 분석하는 다양한 도구를
   제공할 수 있다. 이와 같은 상황은 ‘롱데이터’와 밀접한 관계를 갖는 인문학에서도 예외는 아니다. 롱데이터란 아날로그 방식의
   소규모 데이터이지만 오랜 기간 축적되어, 빅데이터에 못지않은 중요성을 갖는 자료를 뜻한다. 이러한 상황에서, 지금까지 출판된 서적
   전부를 디지털 형태로 바꾸고자 하는 ‘구글북스 프로젝트’는 인문학에서 의미가 있다. 롱데이터를 디지털화하고 나면, 중요하나 그동안
   눈에 띄지 않은 사실들이 발견될 수 있다는 점에서 그렇다.부산대학교 ‘인문정보학센터’는 19세기 중엽부터 20세기 초까지의 한국
   근대 개항기를 인문학의 다른 하위 분야들과 함께 연구해 왔다. 그 시대 서구 선교사나 외교관이 만든 ‘한국어 이개어 사전’이 주요
   연구 대상의 하나이다. 언어의 장벽 때문에 심화연구가 이루어지지 않았던 영역인 것이다. 이때, 숨겨져 있던 고문서에 접근하여
   알려지지 않은 사실을 발견하도록 도와준 것이 바로 정보학이다. 인문정보학센터는 한국어 이개어 사전 여섯 개를 디지털화 한 바
   있고, 그 가운데 세 개는 지식베이스화하였으며, 일반인들에게 공개하였다. 인문정보학센터가 제공하는 디지털 버전은 현재 구체적이고
   믿을 수 있는 지식베이스로, 본 센터뿐만 아니라 다른 한국의 학자들에게도 제공되고 있는 것이다. 그렇지만 인문정보학센터의 과제가
   완수된 것은 아니다. 위에서 언급한 개항기의 더 많은 텍스트를 디지털화해야 하는 작업이 남아있다. 좀더 개방적이고 효율적인 인문학
   연구를 위해, 다수의 인문한국 연구단이 각자의 관련 텍스트를 디지털화하고 공유하는 공동연구 체제인 ‘클라우드 방식’을 제안한다.

AB Digital humanities is an effort to facilitate the pursuit and
   application of humanities knowledge in the era of digital expression and
   communication. To contribute to the scholarly research by
   revolutionizing the research methods is one of Digital Humanities'
   primary goals. But beyond it, Digital Humanities is also concerened with
   the humanities education for the next generation who are digital
   natives; as well as the application of humanities knowledge in creative
   industry for a wider audience. This is by the same token that the
   traditional humanities does not limit itself to the speicalized research
   in disciplines such as literature, philosophy, and history, but involves
   itself also in the humanities education and the social application of
   humanities knowledge.In this paper, I specified the goal of digital
   humanities into three subfields, namely research, education, and
   application. Then, I introduced the Historical Family Document Archives
   Project by the Academy of Korean Studies, as a case that illustrates how
   digital humanities is used in the research of historical documents.
   Finally, I explained how such approach may further be used in the
   humanities education in college, as well as the development of culture
   content for a wider audience.
AK 디지털 인문학(Digital Humanities)이란 디지털로 표현하고 디지털로 소통하는 이 시대에 인문지식이 더욱 의미 있게
   탐구되고 가치 있게 활용되도록 하려는 노력이다. 디지털 인문학은 연구 방법의 혁신을 통해 인문학 본연의 학술 연구에 기여하는 것을
   일차적인 과제로 삼는다. 그러나 전통적인 인문학이 문학, 사학, 철학 등 분과 학문의 전문적인 연구만을 가리키는 것이 아니고,
   인문적인 교양 교육과 인문지식의 사회적 응용에도 관심을 갖듯이, 디지털 인문학도 디지털 원어민인 오늘날의 학생들에게 인문 지식을
   교육하는 일, 그리고 인문지식을 대중들을 위한 문화콘텐츠로 활용하는 일도 과제로 삼는다.필자는 이 글을 통해 디지털 인문학이
   추구하는 과제를 연구, 교육, 응용의 세 가지 측면에서 살펴보았다. 그리고, 고문헌 자료를 대상으로 하는 디지털 인문학 연구의
   방법을 보이기 위해 한국학중앙연구원의 문중 고문서 아카이브 구축 연구를 사례를 소개하고, 이러한 방법을 대학의 인문학 교육과
   문화콘텐츠 개발에 활용할 수 있는 가능성을 제시하였다.

AB We have entered the era of big data. Big data has become a major topic
   in various fields including economics, management, medicine, and
   computer science. This paper is a comprehensive review of the role that
   the ‘digital humanities’ has played in overcoming the limitations of
   traditional humanities in this era of big data. In particular, through
   investigation of the research trends within the digital humanities, we
   point out that the digital humanities in domestic research communities
   are still rudimentary compared to the western research communities. In
   this paper, we present a comprehensive view of how the digital
   humanities should be further established in Korea. In addition, by
   introducing some case studies related to the use of big data in Korea,
   we argue that the digital humanities are not an attempt to replace the
   existing traditional humanities, and they are not merely an
   industrialization of the humanities. Rather, we argue that the digital
   humanities can contribute to expanding the horizons of the humanities,
   pointing them in a new direction by utilizing new "digital" tools and
   methodologies.​
AK 이 논문은 빅 데이터 시대 속에서 기존의 인문학이 가진 한계를 극복하기 위해 대두되고 있는 ‘디지털 인문학’의 위상과 범위, 역할
   등에 대해 종합적으로 검토하는 데에 주된 초점이 있다. 특히 국내의 디지털 인문학에 대한 논의는 초창기의 수준에 머물러 있음을
   국내외의 연구동향을 검토하면서 살펴보고 디지털 인문학이 국내에 어떤 식으로 정립되어야 할 것인가에 대한 포괄적인 견해를 제시한다.
   또한 빅 데이터의 활용과 관련하여 국내에서 진행되고 있는 몇몇 사례를 소개, 검토함으로써 디지털 인문학은 기존 인문학을 대체하려는
   시도가 아님을 강조할 것이다. 특히 인문학을 산업화와 연계시키려는 몇몇 제안에 문제가 있음을 지적하고, 디지털 인문학은
   “디지털”이라는 새로운 도구와 방법론을 활용하여 인문학의 지평을 새로운 차원으로 승화시키는 데 기여할 수 있다는 점을 강조할

AB The researcher presents humanities that understands, interprets, and
   leads technology as a new methodology that will replace digital
   humanities. This challenging humanities research methodology, which can
   be conceptualized as “Humanities engineering,” declares the beginning of
   the 3.0 humanities era.If traditional humanities was humanities 1.0,
   digital humanities, which actively attempted to recruit IT as a research
   methodology is 2.0, and humanities engineering that aims to view humans
   and society from a deeper and broader viewpoint than technology by
   taking the help of technology is humanities 3.0.This process is
   organized in the following table .The ancient Greeks did not distinguish
   between art and technology. They used and applied the term
   “technology”to art and practice, that is, piece and stonemason. However,
   in this era, humanities has reached the highest level of achievement. As
   technology, which was a mere shadow of the arts so far, created a new
   form called information that is comparable to art, the meaning of the
   human, who is the creator of art, user of technology, consumer of
   information, and producer of knowledge, became more important. Now,
   humanities should interpret not only art but also technology. If the
   function of interpreting symbols has not been abandoned, the symbol of
   technology should also be the subject of humanities research.Art and
   technology are fraternal twins. Although both use tools, they are
   different in terms of form, content, function, efficiency, value, and
   orientation.So far, humanities only considered romance, emotion, and the
   aesthetic world as a subject of interpretation by having art as the
   target text. However, humanities engineering determines practice,
   efficiency, and convenience from the human perspective. The core of
   humanities engineering is to interpret technology as humanities. The
   reason this is important is that technology mimics humans and all
   technology is “expansion of humans” as pointed out by McLuhan. Viewing
   technology from the human perspective will be another way of thinking
   and reflecting on ourselves.

AB The present study aims to explore new directions of Korean humanities in
   digital era because it can be taken into consideration that humanities
   should respond to demands of the society and needs of the students.
   Especially, it is necessary to prepare for the future of the younger
   generations who are already accustomed to the digital media. The view of
   the writer is that humanities can provide the students with a variety of
   opportunities to experience from digital humanities as well as
   traditional humanities. This article examined the necessity of digital
   humanities and cases in the foreign countries followed by definition of
   the term humanities and digital humanities. According to the previous
   cases, digital humanities can give various advantages to the current and
   future students because it can contribute to the sustainable growth of
   entire humanities and students’ career development. Futhermore, it can
   facilitate research and education of humanities through using digital
   skills and bridging between the younger and older generations. It is
   desirable to develop useful programs which are able to be feasible in
   the Korean universities. To that end, it is recommendable to further
   research into concrete curricula, courses, and syllabi and so on for
   digital humanities.
AK 이 논문에서는 디지털 시대에 인문학의 새로운 방향을 모색하고자 하였다. 인문학의 위기를 기회로 삼기 위해서는 시대와 사회의 요청에
   부응하는 변화가 필요하기 때문이다. 특히 디지털 미디어에 익숙한 후속 세대들이 인문학을 계속 연구하고 공부하기 위한 준비를 할
   필요가 있다. 이러한 배경에서 본 논문은 전통적인 인문학과 더불어 디지털인문학도 병행해야 한다는 입장에서 출발하여, 디지털인문학의
   필요성과 외국의 현황 및 한국에서의 가능성과 방향에 대해 고찰하였다. 외국에서는 디지털인문학에 대한 연구와 교육이 자리를 잡아가고
   있는 것으로 보인다. 한국의 대학에서도 인문학이 전통적인 방법만을 고수하기보다는 디지털인문학의 장점을 최대한 살릴 수 있는 방법을
   찾아야 한다. 인문학의 지속적인 발전과 디지털 시대의 학생들이 다양한 진로를 개발하는 데 디지털인문학이 유용하기 때문이다. 기존의
   인문학에 새로운 가능성을 통합하기 위해, 여기에서 제시된 이론과 사례들을 각 대학의 실정에 맞게 활용할 수 있을 것이다. 디지털
   시대에 세계가 상호 소통하고 있는 상황에서, 한국 인문학이 세계적인 흐름을 수용하여 인문학의 세대 간 연결을 준비할 수 있기를
   기대한다. 이 논문의 한계는 연구자의 주장과 논증에 의한 학술적 창의성이 부족하고 외국의 사례 중심 소개의 수준이라는 점이다.
   그럼에도 불구하고, 한국의 대학에서 시작 단계에 있는 디지털인문학을 통한 새로운 방식의 인문학 연구와 교육에 대한 담론 형성에
   기여한다는 점에서 이 논문의 의의를 찾을 수 있다.

AB Humanities scholars agree that the visualization of their data should
   bring order and insight, reveal patterns and provide leads for new
   research questions. However, simple two-dimensional visualizations are
   often too static and too generic to meet these needs. Visualization
   tools for the humanities should be able to deal with the observer
   dependency, heterogeneity, uncertainty and provenance of data and the
   complexity of humanities research questions. They should furthermore
   offer scholars the opportunity to interactively manipulate their data
   sets and queries. In this paper, we introduce Storyteller, an open
   source visualization tool designed to interactively explore complex data
   sets for the humanities. We present the tool, and demonstrate its
   applicability in three very different humanities projects.

   attitudes and perceptions of digital scientific information landscape.
   The results of the research show that use of digital scientific
   information resources including use of open access information resources
   has become a constant activity among students in their daily academic
   activities. The students who participated in the research demonstrated
   their familiarity with the key characteristics of digital information
   resources which suggests their increased competence for selection and
   use of digital scientific information resources in their education. The
   increase in use of scientific digital content on mobile devices has also
   become a steady trend which calls for adapting digital content used in
   student's education. Unfortunately, students are still mostly
   self-taught about use of digital scientific information resources which
   should be changed.

AB Electronics cultural atlas is a typical methodology for the Digital
   Humanities. Since electronic cultural atlas could visualize various
   cultural information based on electronic atlas, that is an information
   visualization, users are able to make intuitive understanding on
   specific areas. Therefore, it can be effectively utilized in Area
   Studies and also helps users to understand comprehensively information
   on historic event in particular area with time information, because
   electronic cultural atlas represents a particular subject and time
   information with geographical information based on map. In other words,
   electronic cultural atlas may be considered as a specialized system of
   Digital Humanities for studying the Humanities and Area Studies. In this
   paper, we design and implement mediterranean electronic cultural
   atlas(MECA) for researchers of the Mediterranean area that has cultural
   hybridity formed the exchange of various aspects such as civilization,
   religion, race and language. In detail, a 'Digital Humanities Research
   Support System' is constructed to visualize research outcomes related to
   the Mediterranean area on Electronic Cultural Atlas and to use for
   researches.
AK 전자문화지도는 디지털인문학을 위한 하나의 방법으로 기본적으로 문화정보를 지도를 활용해 시각화, 즉 정보시각화로 나타내므로 사용자는
   해당 지역에 대한 직관적인 이해가 가능하다. 따라서 지역 연구에 효율적으로 활용될 수 있으며, 특히 지도를 기반으로 한 지리정보와
   더불어 특정 주제, 시간 정보를 연계하여 나타내므로 특정 지역에서 일어난 역사적 사건 등에 대한 정보를 시간 정보와 함께
   통합적으로 이해할 수 있다. 즉 전자문화지도는 특정 지역을 인문Â·지역학을 중심으로 연구하는데 특화된 디지털인문학 시스템이라고 할
   수 있다. 본 논문에서는 문명, 종교, 지역, 인종, 언어 등의 문화가 다양한 양상의 교류로 인해 혼종되어 있는 지중해 지역을
   대상으로 지중해 지역 연구를 위한 지중해전자문화지도(MECA: Mediterranean Electronic Cultural
   Atlas)를 설계 및 구현한다. 세부적으로 지중해지역과 관련된 연구결과물을 전자문화지도상에 시각화하여 표현하고 이를 연구에
   활용할 수 있도록 하는 ‘디지털인문학 연구지원시스템’을 구축한다.

AB Digital Humanities System is a method to effectively share and spread
   Humanities information and knowledge to users by using information
   technology. It Also comes into the spotlight as a new research
   methodology for researches of Humanities researchers. Digital Humanities
   System distinguishes itself from other existing information systems.
   Therefore, when the system is developed, it needs to supply with
   manpower related to development process which is specialized for Digital
   Humanities System, not for the several established construction
   methodology. Digital Humanities System studies recently is mostly
   constructed using the usual methodology of information system
   construction. Because of its falling efficiency and usability after
   constructing the system, however, examples of failure of operating
   system occur. In this paper, accordingly, effective and creative Digital
   Humanities System development methodology will be studied from the point
   of view of information technology through collaboration with various
   field of expertise. In detail, based on information system methodologies
   in software engineering perspective, we propose a methodology to build a
   specialized system in the digital humanities.
AK 디지털 인문학 시스템은 정보기술을 활용하여 인문정보나 지식을 사용자에게 효율적으로 공유 및 확산하는 방안이다. 또한 인문학을
   연구하는 연구자들에게는 새로운 연구방법론으로 주목받고 있다. 디지털 인문학 시스템은 기존의 정보시스템과는 차별화된 성격을 가진다.
   따라서 시스템 구축 시 기존의 정보시스템 구축 방법론이 아닌 디지털 인문학 시스템에 특화된 개발 절차와 관련 인력을 구성할 필요가
   있다. 최근 연구되는 디지털 인문학 시스템은 절차나 방법론 없이 기존의 정보시스템 구축 방법론을 통해 구축되는 경우가 대부분이며
   이로 인해 시스템 구축 후 사용성이나 효율성이 떨어져 시스템 운영에 실패하는 사례가 발생한다. 이에 따라 본 연구에서는 정보기술의
   관점에서 다양한 전문분야와의 협업을 통해 효과적이고 창조적인 ‘디지털 인문학 시스템’ 개발 방법에 대해 연구한다. 세부적으로
   소프트웨어 공학 관점에서의 정보시스템 구축방법론을 기반으로 디지털 인문학 시스템에 특화된 구축 방법을 제시하고자 한다.

AB Recently, the Digital Humanities (DH) have arisen as a new trend in
   Korean academic studies, starting from 2012, when the Korean Government
   launched a DH project. The focus of these efforts has been in the
   cultural sphere, transforming our understanding of the achievements of
   the humanities by utilizing digital technology. DH has also flourished
   in Taiwan, where digital technology has been applied to all kinds of
   research processes, and in particular to conceptual history, which has a
   natural affinity with DH. The main methods of conceptual history,
   language analysis and macro-analysis, are closely related to the
   analysis of linguistic information and big data investigated by DH.
   Conceptual history researchers in both Korea and Taiwan have already
   found the combination of conceptual history and DH to be a fruitful
   partnership which shows long-term potential. This combination also
   promises to help enlarge the area to which DH is applied in Korea, by
   examining cultural content through digitizing texts and constructing
   databases; and DH education should provide a spur to innovation in
   academic research. Ultimately it is hoped that the combination of
   conceptual history and DH can raise the profile of both fields.
AK 최근 한국 학계에서 디지털인문학이 새로운 경향으로 부상하고 있다. 2012년 디지털인문학에 대한 관심이 본격적으로 제기되기 시작한
   후 2014년부터 디지털인문학이 정부지원사업의 항목으로 지정되었으며, 전국단위 학술행사에서 디지털인문학을 다루는 횟수가 점차
   증가하고 있다. 그런데 디지털인문학에 대한 기존의 관심 대부분은 연구 성과를 콘텐츠로 가공해서 대중화하는 작업, 디지털시대에
   발맞춘 교육과정 개발에 초점을 맞추고 있다. 그것과 차별화되는 사례로 대만의 디지털인문학은 연구의 설계와 과정에서 방법론적으로
   디지털기술을 활용하는 연구에 중점을 둔다. 한편 본질적으로 디지털인문학의 방법은 개념사연구와 친화성을지닌다. 언어분석을 통해
   개념의 형성과 변천을 거시적으로 조망하는 개념사 연구에 디지털인문학의 언어정보분석과 빅데이터분석이 그 성격에 부합하기 때문이다.
   따라서 디지털인문학은 개념사 연구의 혁신을 성취하는 계기가 된다. 한국과대만의 개념사 연구자들은 이미 상당 기간 개념사와
   디지털인문학의 결합이 갖는긍정적 의미에 공감하고 장기적 전망 속에서 지속 발전과 협력을 도모해 왔다. 한국에서 디지털인문학과
   개념사의 결합은 디지털인문학의 외연을 기존의 문화/ 인문콘텐츠, 자료전산화, 디지털인문학 교육에서 연구 혁신 분야로 확장한다는
   의미도 갖는다. 궁극적으로 개념사와 디지털인문학의 결합은 개념사와 한국의 디지털 인문학 모두에게 새로운 도약의 계기가 된다.

AB This paper introduces digital writing in college humanities class using
   Wiki. For this, it first has examined the usability of digital
   humanities study in research and educational areas based on what the
   digital humanities is, the humanities in which information and
   communication technology. The paper has then explored the concept and
   characteristics of Wiki, a tool used for digital writing, and reviewed
   existing cases in which it was applied. This paper also introduces a
   case of class for the production of ‘key word contents in the history of
   Korean classic literature’ carried in the first semester in 2016.Wiki
   can be used in both research and educational areas especially as users
   can cooperatively create and modify tests in Wiki among other digital
   technology tools. Several domestic and foreign colleges and universities
   as such are making efforts to promote the quality of class by using Wiki
   educationally. It has been reported that one can get significant results
   in classes mainly requiring cooperative activities with the tool, and it
   is helpful for increasing one’s writing ability.We have been once again
   able to confirm the educational utility of Wiki via the class for the
   production of ‘key word contents in the history of Korean classic
   literature.’ The class was carried out in 4 steps including ‘finding out
   classic genres,’ ‘drawing relational networks,’ ‘writing key words out,’
   and ‘digital sentence composition.’ Before and after the mid-term exam
   in the 8th week during the 15 week semester, each group was led to find
   out classic literary genres for helping their understanding of what
   classic literature is, that is, the general structure and construction
   of classic literature, and they were encouraged to draw a relational
   network of classic literature genres and upload it on the Wiki page.
   After the mid-term exam, each member in the class was assigned keywords
   they would write out individually, and the education of Wiki grammar for
   writing out keywords and digital writing as a step for Wiki page
   composition were carried out.We have found out two features of digital
   writing in the course of making digital contents using Wiki. First, it
   is possible to use it as a tool for cooperative writing, and second, it
   enables self-directed writing. The best achievement from this study
   above all is that the students felt responsible as their group and
   individual products were uploaded and showed online, and had a sense of
   achievement in that they had expressed their own knowledge on Internet.
AK 본 논문은 위키(Wiki)를 활용한 대학 인문학 수업의 디지털 글쓰기 교육에 대해 소개하였다. 이를 위하여 먼저 인문학에
   정보통신기술을 접목한 디지털 인문학이란 무엇인지, 디지털 인문학의 연구영역과 교육영역에의 활용 가능성에 대하여 알아보았다. 이어서
   디지털 글쓰기의 도구로 사용될 위키(Wiki)의 개념과 특징을 알아보고, 교육 영역에 적용된 기존 사례를 검토해보았다. 또한
   2016년 1학기에 진행된 ‘고전문학사 핵심어 콘텐츠’ 제작 수업 사례를 소개하였다.위키는 다양한 디지털 기술 도구 중에서도 특히
   사용자 간에 협력적으로 문서를 작성하고 수정할 수 있어서 연구 영역이나 교육 영역에 모두 활용이 가능하다. 그렇기 때문에 이미
   국내외 여러 대학에서는 위키를 교육적으로 활용하여 수업의 질을 높이려는 노력을 하고 있다. 주로 협력적 활동을 필요로 하는
   수업에서 유의미한 결과를 얻을 수 있었고, 글쓰기 능력 향상에 도움이 되는 것으로 알려졌다.‘고전문학사 핵심어 콘텐츠’ 제작 수업
   사례를 통해서 위키의 교육적 활용성에 대해서 다시 한 번 확인해 볼 수 있었다. ‘고전문학사 핵심어 콘텐츠’ 제작 수업은
   ‘고전장르 찾기’, ‘관계망 그리기’, ‘핵심어 작성하기’, ‘디지털 문장쓰기’의 4단계로 진행되었다. 15주의 수업 기간 중
   8주에 시행되는 중간고사를 전후로 하여 중간고사 이전에는 고전문학이란 무엇인지, 고전문학의 전반적인 구조와 짜임새의 이해를 돕기
   위해서 그룹별로 고전문학 장르를 찾아보고, 고전문학 장르의 관계망을 그려 위키 페이지에 올리도록 하였다. 중간고사 이후에는 구성원
   개별적으로 작성하게 될 핵심어를 분배하고, 핵심어 작성을 위한 위키 문법 교육과, 실질적 위키 페이지 작성 단계인 디지털 글쓰기를
   실행하였다.위키를 활용하여 디지털 콘텐츠 결과물을 만들어내는 과정에서 두 가지의 디지털 글쓰기 특징을 확인할 수 있었다. 첫째,
   협력적 글쓰기 도구로 활용 가능하며, 둘째, 자기 주도적 글쓰기를 가능하게 한다는 점이다. 무엇보다도 최대의 성과는 그룹별,
   개인별 결과물이 온라인상에 빠르게 게시되고 공유되면서 책임감을 갖게 되고, 인터넷상에 자신들만의 지식을 직접 표현해냈다는 점에서
   성취감을 느끼게 하였다는 점이다.

AB This study is distinct from existing studies on cell phones in that it
   proposes a new concept, “mobile mise-en-scene,” based on an analysis of
   video images that focuses on the changes in human thought and behavior
   caused by cell phones, from a humanities perspective. The term “mobile
   mise-en-scene” refers to images of cell phones in film narratives. An
   in-depth analysis was carried out using digital materials, specifically,
   all Korean films made from the time cell phones were first introduced
   until now, and significant scenes were found in nine films. Based on
   this research, this study suggests the following six types of mobile
   mise-en-scene, which are linked with three concepts of mobile
   media.Firstly, “mobile habitus” and “mobile handling” mise-en-scene can
   be deduced, based on the concept of “mobile object.” The former means
   cell phones as the privileged class’s cultural capital, and the latter
   refers to the combined motion of a body with a cell phone.Secondly,
   “dual-stage” and “mobile synopticon” mise-en-scene can be deduced, which
   come into being by virtue of “telepresence.” The former means
   coexistence within physical and virtual spaces, and the latter emerges
   to struggle against electronic synopticon. Thirdly, with respect to “the
   right to disconnection,” “disconnectopia” is a blend word formed from
   disconnection and utopia, and “disconnection hierarchy” is the
   discriminatory right of disconnection that is graded by
   authority.Proceeding from what has been said above, this article is an
   attempt to converge concepts regarding the history of private life in
   the humanities perspective with digital images found in film to lay a
   foundation for broadening the horizon of digital humanities.
AK 본 연구는 인문학적 관점에서 휴대전화가 야기한 인간의 사고와 행동의 변화에초점을 맞춘다. 영상이미지를 분석하여 ‘모바일
   미장센’이라는 새로운 개념을 창안했다는 점에서 이 분야 타 연구와 차별성을 지니는데, 여기서 모바일 미장센이란 영화의 내러티브
   속에서 휴대전화를 중심으로 연출된 이미지를 말한다. 연구의 범위는휴대전화 보급 초창기부터 최근까지 제작된 모든 국내 영화를
   대상으로 하였고, 그중 디지털 파일의 형태로 보존된 영화를 분석 자료로 활용하였다. 이를 바탕으로모바일 미디어에 관한 3가지 주요
   개념을 도출하였다.첫째는 모바일 오브제의 개념인데, 이는 물건으로서의 휴대전화가 지닌 아우라라든가, 휴대전화와 신체가 결합한
   유의미한 몸짓들로 구체화된다. 둘째는 원격현전의개념으로, 휴대전화의 초공간적인 존재감이 실현시킨 물리적 공간과 가상적 공간의공존
   및 그것이 새로운 감시체계로 작동하는 각종 양상들이다. 셋째는 탈접속의권리에 관한 개념인데, 문명화 이전의 이상향을 경험할
   권리로서의 탈접속이 있는가하면, 상대에게 위계적 영향력을 행사하는 탈접속도 있다. 첨단 기술 분야의 디지털이미지 아카이브와
   인문학적 시각을 투영한 사생활의 역사를 융합한 본 연구는 디지털인문학 담론의 지평을 넓힐 수 있다는 점에서 의의가 있다.

AB Digital Humanities, that is, the intersection between computing and the
   humanities, may serve as the means to save the humanities from its
   “crisis.” Digital Humanists however, assert the necessity of change
   within traditional humanities. They especially emphasize the need for
   open collaboration absent in the field of humanities. This need brings
   about controversies within Digital Humanities itself that need to be
   resolved in ways that promote deeper understanding of the nature of the
   humanities.

AB I think it is valuable to make Chinese ancient character 'Inscriptions
   on Bones and Tortoise Carapaces' hieroglyphics popular by combining with
   the digital. Because Chinese characters are ideograms, it has a huge
   visual effect. When it is thought over meanings with imaged data by
   using digital technology, it can be easier to conflate Chinese academia
   and humanities academia, moreover other academia that uses Chinese
   characters such as jurisprudence or business administration. I believe
   not only union of humanities and natural science in the global era can
   be the best example of the word 'consilience', which I mentioned before,
   but also people enjoy usability from educations, invention of learning
   contents or open learning to a cultural field by coming into wide use.
   Futhermore, it should contribute to changing the image of Chinese
   characteristics from existing difficult stereotype to positive image.
AK 중국의 고대 문자인 “갑골문” 상형문자를 디지털과 결합시켜 대중화 시키는 것도 매우 의미 있는 일이라 사료된다. 표의문자
   (表意文字) 인 중국 문자는 표음 문자 (表音文字) 인 한글과는 다르게, 보여 지는 시각효과가 크고 또 그 이미지화된 자료를
   가지고 의미를 상고해 내는 작업을 함에 있어서 디지털의 기술을 빌려 쓴다면, 앞으로 중문학계는 물론이고 더 나아가 인문학계와
   융합하는 문제는 시간문제라는 생각이 든다. 고대(상형) 문자를 컴퓨터과학, 즉 디지털과 결합시킨다는 것은 e-learing 의
   기술적인 도입과 결합과도 상관이 있을 것 같은데, 앞으로 디지털 시대를 맞아하여 인문학과 자연과학과의 결합이 절실해 지리라 본다.
   이를 위하여 e-learning 과 디지털 교육이 시급하며, 상형문자(표의문자)의 데이터베이스 구축 및 자료화 작업은 교육에
   있어서도 매우 유용할 것이라 사료된다.

   in-depth interview and content analysis on publishing and citing
   behaviors in literature was executed. The steps of research process is
   identified as a non-linear combination of 3 parts: developing research
   idea, developing the research idea to write, and submitting manuscript
   to publish. Prominent implementations of cyberscholarship were found in
   the 2nd step for accessing and using research data and literatures.

AB The development of digital technology is changing the way of human
   perception and communication, including the way of writing and
   publication. It is reasonable that the scholars of humanities have
   concerns for this transformation of media. The history of humanities has
   been constructed by book publication.The current studies of media
   humanities focuss on the dissemination media (language, picture,
   photography, movie, computer, etc.), which have been researched mainly
   by the science of communication. But the success media (money, power,
   truth, love, trust, etc.) which have been researched by sociology are
   out of media humanities’ view.In this paper, I will try to extend the
   field of view for media humanities by referring to the media theory of
   Niklas Luhmann. I will define the concept of media, distinguish between
   dissemination median and success media, and research the tension between
   two kinds of media. The variance of love after romantic love, the
   dynamization and the risk of money in the digital epoch, and the crisis
   of the rule of law are included.
AK 디지털 전자매체 기술의 눈부신 발전이 인간의 지각세계와 커뮤니케이션 방식을 현격하게 바꾸어놓고 있다. 글과 인쇄의 성격도 바뀌고

   연구되어온 매체, 즉 ‘확산매체’에 관해서는 비교적 활발한 연구가 이루어지고 있다. 하지만 사회학이 전통적으로 다루어왔던 매체인
   화폐, 권력, 진리, 사랑, 신뢰 등에 관한 연구는 희소하거나 확산매체와 무관하게 논의되고 있는 것으로 보인다.그래서 나는 이
   글을 통해 매체에 관한 인문학적 논의의 시각을 확장하려 한다. 니클라스 루만의 매체이론을 참조하여 우선 매체 개념을 명확히 할
   것이며 그에 기초해 엄밀한 매체 분류를 하려 한다. 나는 특히 커뮤니케이션의 확산매체와 성공매체를 구별하는 것이 중요하며, 오늘날
   이 두 종류의 매체 사이에 일어나고 있는 긴장에 주목해야 한다고 본다. 나는 이 글에서 사랑, 화폐, 법 등이 디지털 전자매체의
   시대에 어떤 도전을 받고 있는지 추적한다. 현대 사회의 구조를 허물지도 모르는 새로운 확산매체와 현대 사회의 구조를 지탱해온
   오래된 성공매체 사이의 긴장은 지금 일어나고 있는 변화를 개념화하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

   case of the Dongdaemun-Gu Public Digital Library with emphasis on 2013
   and 2014 when the library tried to develop professionalism of
   librarianship in relation to lectures on humanities. And, based upon the
   analysis on the process of the program and survey results, this study
   intends to examine the relationship between professionalism of
   librarianship in public libraries and humanities lectures for public in

AB The CIVIC EPISTEMOLOGIES project investigates citizen science and
   crowdsourcing in the domain of the research in Digital Cultural Heritage
   and Humanities (DCHH). The ultimate aim is to produce a validated
   Roadmap indicating the suggested direction that the deployment of
   services and infrastructures should take, in order to support the
   participation of citizens in the research processes and the
   participation of creative industries in the exploitation of digital
   cultural content. The case of DCHH is particularly relevant because of
   the major cross-cutting role that the humanities play in European
   research and innovation, recently acknowledged in a clear way in the
   Horizon2020 Community Programme for Research and Innovation. Cultural
   heritage and humanities also represent a subject area in which citizens
   are particularly active, counting several still spread - experiences of
   their involvement in recording, annotating and cataloguing activities on
   an individual or group basis, as volunteers and amateurs. The case of
   broadening e-Infrastructure deployment to support the participation of
   citizens to DCHH research, even if holding a strong impact potential for
   social cohesion and job development, is not yet fully explored. The
   paper discusses about the multidisciplinary approach to citizen science
   and how this method can contribute to the benefit of many scientific
   domains, research communities, and technology advancements as well as
   delivering novel social and economic impact.

AB The massive digitization of books and manuscripts has converted millions
   of works that were once only physical into electronic documents. This
   conversion has made it possible for scholars to study large bodies of
   work, rather than just individual texts. This has offered new
   opportunities for scholarship in the humanities. Much previous work on
   digital collections has relied on optical character recognition and
   focused on the textual content of books. New work is emerging that is
   analyzing the visual layout and content of books and manuscripts. We
   present two different digital humanities projects in progress that
   present new opportunities for extracting data about the past, with new
   challenges for designing systems for scholars to interact with this
   data. The first project we consider is the layout and spectral content
   of thousands of pages from medieval manuscripts. We present the
   techniques used to study content variations in sets of similar
   manuscripts, and to study material variations that may indicate the
   location of manuscript production. The second project is the analysis of
   representations in the complete archive of Vogue magazine over 120
   years. We present samples of applying computer vision techniques to
   understanding the changes in representation of women over time.

AB This paper presents the design of an application for engagement with
   audiovisual digital cultural heritage in the classroom, called the
   Carrot. The aim of this interactive tool is to make online cultural
   heritage accessible and understandable for students in different levels
   of education. In relation to this work we pose two research questions:
   Why do we need to develop tools for contextualization of audiovisual
   cultural heritage? And: How do we design and develop such tools? The
   preliminary answers to these questions come from our experiences in the
   design process, which deepened our understanding of a tool in the
   context of the classroom. We then relate this to the digital humanities
   project, EUscreenXL. Initial conclusions suggest that tools for
   contextualization of audiovisual cultural heritage can engage students
   with cultural heritage, develop digital media literacy, and support
   contemporary didactics. These tools need to be developed across
   platforms, using nonproprietary software and involving a
   multidisciplinary group of experts.

AB This study investigates the structure of Digital humanity research
   community by quantitatively analyzing Digital humanity research projects
   funded by Taiwan government in recent thirty years. Taiwan's Digital
   humanity research networks composed by research community and knowledge
   distribution are quantitatively investigated by the use of network
   theory and Taiwan's Digital humanity research map is created to obtain
   the purpose of two-dimensional visualization. The three-dimensional
   networks and two-dimensional knowledge maps on the basis of the Taiwan's
   Digital humanity research projects can be depicted differently by
   choosing different information as network actor, e.g. institute
   department or keyword, to reflect Digital humanity research structures
   in macro, meso, and micro-levels, respectively. Digital humanity
   research projects are retrieved from GRB (Government Research Bulletin)
   database which archives research projects sponsored by Taiwan
   government. A total of 883 projects conducted by 117 institutes are
   retrieved in this study, a total of 2045 keywords are identified from
   the 883 projects for network construction. The obtained results can be
   used by the government to evaluate how to allocate research funding to
   the field of Digital humanity.

AB It has been almost a quarter of a century since the ‘crisis of
   humanities’ was promulgated, and it faces a new challenge by the
   influence of ICT industries; the demand for digitalizing of humanities.
   Under this harsh circumstance, it seems that the change into digital
   humanities is the only way for the ‘humanities in crisis’ to keep
   surviving, and this belief is disseminated purposedly in the context of
   the digitization phenomena all across the world including the U.S., many
   countries in the E.U. China, Japan, and Canada.Notwithstanding, it is
   highly suspicious that the change (humanities  digital humanities) is a
   proper way to fulfill the fundamental purpose of the humanities of
   ‘studia humanitatis’, and an adequate knowledge mapping of the future.In
   this piece, the ways of defending the real value of humanities from the
   evaluation plots of technology and market are discussed. It is argued
   that the over-interpretation and worship of the digital humanities as a
   panacea or the public good of this area, is harmful for the humanities.
   It is also argued that the humanities as ‘authentic’ cannot be replaced
   by the digital humanities as replica.
AK 인문학에 대한 진단을 ‘위기’로 평가한지 거의 4반세기가 되어간다. 헌데ICT산업의 전방위적 확산으로 인해 인문학은 재차 변신을
   강요받고 있다.‘인문학의 디지털화’가 바로 그 요구이다. 국내에서 디지털인문학으로의 변신만이 인문학의 생존을 보장할 수 있을
   것이란 믿음이 확산되고 있는 배경은 미국을 필두로 유럽연합국가들이며 중국, 일본, 캐나다 등 전 세계의많은 국가에서 이에
   선도적으로 대처하려는 움직임과 무관하지 않다.하지만 이러한 변신(인문학  디지털인문학)이 과연 ‘인간성의 탐구(studia
   humanitatis)’라는 인문학의 본래 목적에 부합하는지, 그리고 그것이 과연 미래의 지식 지형에 대한 진지한 고민의 결과라
   할 수 있는지 의심이 든다. 본고에서 우리는 이런 취지로 기술가치와 시장가치로부터 인문학을 해방시킬수 있는 방안은 없는지 고민해
   보았다. 디지털인문학에 대한 맹목적 믿음이 시대적 변화의 공의(公儀)를 대변하는 것인 양 과잉 해석되는 것은 결코 인문학의 진흥을
   위해 득이 되지 않는다고 판단해서다. 감히 주장하건대, ‘본디 것’인 인문학의 기준에서 볼 때 디지털인문학은 다분히
   인문학의부차적인 작업에 그칠 수밖에 없다.

AB Since interdisciplinary convergence could beyond the borders of each
   disciplines, it is able to create new and meaningful knowledge through
   collaborative research between different study areas. Especially, in
   recent years, the Digital Humanities has attracted the attention as the
   convergence form of the Humanities and ICT. From a research methodology
   perspective, the Digital Humanities is a tool that can be used as a
   convergence system for various information utilization such as storage,
   retrieve, share, and spread. In view of Information system, Digital
   Humanities has been constructed and used in a variety of systems. Among
   them, studies related to information visualization for the Digital
   Humanities have been actively conducted. To visualize data or
   information, various types such as images, multimedia, interface, and
   etc could be applied. In this paper, we analyze the cases of various
   information visualization in digital humanities systems, and propose a
   method to utilize them in the Humanities and Area Studies.

   it adjust historical information on the stream of Korean modern songs
   from the 1920 to the 1930 to a digital environment, in order to activate
   the narrative context of Korean modern musical culture.Thus this paper
   will give an illustrative example of establishing a database through the
   humanities reconstruction. This example, will add a new dimension of
   creating meaning, beyond the mere outcome of changing the media, the
   outcome that one can obtain information about Korean modern songs, i.e.
   composers, poets, lyrics, scores, and musical sound in a digital
   environment. In doing so, this paper will provide a potential of music
   studies as a new theoretical tool for utilizing musical heritage, and
   enhance our understanding of Bongsunhwa.

AB The essay investigates the latest trends in information support of the
   Humanities research, such as the emergence of a new multidisciplinary
   area of research named Digital Humanities. It is a very new upcoming
   area which is still going through formation stages. The term is often
   used as an umbrella for any research in the Humanities that uses
   computer and information technologies, new media and methods, with both
   the Humanities and the Digital understood in their broadest sense.
   Digital Humanities (like Digital History) has not yet developed in
   Russia and the CIS to the same extent as it has in Western countries,
   though the Russian History and Computing Association has already been
   discussing applications of digital technologies in humanities studies
   for a while. Since the Russian association is comprised primarily of
   historians, the author analyses not just the Humanities in general but
   also History and the way it is linked with other disciplines such as
   Information Science, Arts and the Humanities, as well as Social
   Sciences. Historical Information Science (or Historical Informatics) is
   a widespread term in Russia and the CIS, while Digital History itself is
   viewed as a sub-discipline in the frame of Historical Information
   Science that deals with the application of contemporary digital
   technologies to create academic and educational historical resources
   (databases, digital libraries, digital archives, web-sites), electronic
   publications of primary historical sources, digital copies of materials
   stored in museums, archives and libraries.

AB The paper examines Digital Humanities 2014 conference held in Lausanne
   in Switzerland and also discusses the current trends in the discipline
   of Humanities in Koreain keeping up with so-called a new trend of
   digitalization.Under the conference theme of ‘Digital Cultural
   Empowerment’, 223 papers and 115 posters were presented and 873 authors
   were on the list of participants, discussing a variety of research
   questions applying digital technology in the humanities research. In
   particular,Bruno Latour, in his plenary speech with the title of
   ‘Rematerializing Humanities Thanks to Digital Traces’, called attention
   with his no tion of the digital, showing the digital is not a single
   domain but a single entry to bring the expansion of humanities research
   domain. H is point of view on the digital is still in discussion among
   digital humanists, even after theconference.The workshop sessions
   comprised a variety of practical topics which mainly focus on theneeds
   from humanities research and researchers. The participants were given
   practical training of digital technology or opportunities to share the
   experiences or information fromthe leading scholars of the field who are
   mostly involved in managing or directing some major projects or
   developing digital tools or technology. The panel sessions proved
   veryactive efforts of the scholars to expand and systematize the
   methodologies in approachingwith increasingly extending research ideas
   and questions in the field. Through the papersessions, some key words,
   such as ‘topic modeling’, ‘text analysis’, and ‘archives’, weremost
   discussed, proving that text-based research topics or methodologies are
   quite dominant in digital humanities. Also, analyzing the relations
   among all the key words, thekey word ‘collaboration’ was most frequently
   connected with other key words. In moredetail, the key words related to
   text (ex. ‘text analysis’) were in network with other keywords like
   ‘visualization’, ‘project management’, ‘OCR’, and ‘software’,
   through‘collaboration’ which is one of the key features of digital
   humanities. This also implies that the research projects in digital
   humanities are not possible to be done with only one single method and
   by only one or two researchers, but rather requiring collaboration
   andcooperation with skills and knowledge from the researchers and
   organizations or institutes in different fields or
   disciplines.Discussing the interdisciplinary studies of digital and
   humanities in Korea and its similarities and differentces from the U.S
   and Europe, the paper argues that in Korea, also,the humanities research
   with the digital application has been attempted since the 1990s. In
   Korea, the term ‘Culture Contents’ has been used, replacing Digital
   Humanities. It has been developed as a field of study, seeking its
   convergence with commercial activities. However,most the humanists
   involved in this field have been isolated from the digital
   technology.Their lack of the knowledge and skills has resulted in
   failing convergence of humanities and digital and also failing in
   positioning the humanists themselves as the leading agent inthe field.
   In this regard, the paper emphasizes that the practical training program
   needs to be prepared and given to the humanists, to provide the
   knowledge and ideas of digital application. Also, as a way to bring the
   advancement of the field in Korea, it suggests that the humanists in
   Korea create an association of digital humanities and also join in
   umbrella organizations or communities, such as ADHO. Through the
   network, they can share the ideas with the digital humanists in the
   globe.
AK 본 글은 스위스 로잔에서 개최된 2014년 세계디지털인문학 학술대회(DigitalHumanities 2014)를 소개하고, 한국의
   디지털인문학 현황을 검토한 것이다. 이학술대회의 주제는 ‘디지털 문화의 역량강화’(Digital Cultural
   Empowerment)였는데, 이는 인문학 입장에서 디지털 기술의 다양한 접목을 통해 디지털문화의 역량강화를 모색한 것이다. 결국
   이것은 ‘디지털기술’에 방점이 있는 것이 아니라 ‘인문학’에 방점이 있는 것이다.본 대회는 총 223편의 논문발표와 115편의
   포스터가 있었고, 학술대회 참여자명단에는 총 873명의 저자들이 이름을 올렸다. 기조연설이 4편 있었는데, 특히 부르노
   라투르(Bruno Latour)의 연설(Rematerializing Humanities Thanks toDigital
   Traces: 디지털 발전으로 인한 인문학의 재탄생)이 주목되었다. 그는 디지털이라는 개념에 대한 인식을 둘러싼 일반적 오류를
   지적하면서, 디지털인문학에서디지털은 한 영역이라기보다는 인문학 연구의 확장을 가져올 수 있는 도구로 보아야한다고 주장했다. 그리고
   디지털기술은 이전에 추상적 영역에 있던 것들을 경험적영역 속으로 전환하여 구현하는 것을 가능하게 한다는 점을 강조하였다.다양한
   워크샵은 인문학 연구자들에게 필요한 디지털 기술 관련 실용적인 내용들이 다루어졌다. 즉 디지털 툴 또는 프로젝트 소개 및 활용에
   관한 주제와 디지털인문학 연구방법론에 관한 발표가 있었다. 패널 세션은 현재 디지털인문학에서 추진중인 프로젝트 및 방법론 등
   다양한 주제를 가지고 패널 참가자들과의 논의를 통하여 좀 더 발전적인 방향을 모색하고자 하였다. 특히 디지털인문학의 융합적 특성에
   맞추어, 좀 더 실용적이고 체계적이며 세분화된 방법론 정립 및 모색에 대한 노력들이 시도되었다.일반 발표 논문은 제목으로 분석할
   경우, ‘TEI’, ‘topic modeling’, ‘text analysis’,‘archives’라는 키워드가 가장 많이
   사용되었다. 그리고 다수의 키워드들이‘collaboration’이라는 키워드를 중심으로 관계만을 형성하고 있었다.
   즉‘collaboration’을 중심으로 ‘visualisation’, ‘Project Management’,
   ‘OCR’,‘Software’, ‘Tool’, ‘Text analysis’ 등의 키워드가 관계망을 형성하고 있다. 이를바탕으로
   해석해보면, 인문학적 연구방법(text analysis, visualisation)을 토대로 다양한 디지털 기술 및 툴(tool,
   software, OCR 등)이 결합하는 디지털인문학의 연구방법론적 특성을 보여준다고 할 수 있다. 그리고 발표 논문들 대부분이
   2인이상이 참여한 공동 연구들로 이루어져 있어 단독저자 논문을 찾아보기 어려운이유도, 이러한 방법론적 특성으로 인해 인문지식과
   디지털 기술의 공유가 불가피하기 때문인 것으로 해석해 볼 수 있다.또한, ‘visualization’ 을 중심으로 ‘text
   analysis’, ‘text mining’, ‘ontology’,‘poetry’, ‘xml’ 등의 키워드가 관계망을 형성하고
   있는데, 이는 디지털인문학에서의인문학 연구 및 분석을 맵핑(mapping)하고 시각화하려는 경향을 반영한다고 볼수 있다. 끝으로
   디지털인문학의 세계적인 동향과 관련하여, 이번 학술대회를 주관한로잔공과대학(EPFL)의 프레드릭 카플란 교수에 주목할 필요가 있을
   것이다.이러한 세계적인 동향을 한국과 비교하자면 여러 교차점이 발생하면서 유사성과차이성을 보인다고 할 수 있다. 한국도 일찍부터
   인문학과 디지털기술의 결합을시도해 왔다. 더 나아가 그러한 성과가 산업적으로 활용될 수 있도록 ‘문화콘텐츠’라는 새로운 분야를
   개척하여 왔다. 그러나 한국의 경우 가장 아쉬운 점은 인문학자들과 디지털 기술을 구사하는 전문가가 유리되어 있다는 점이다. 이는
   인문학 자료의올바른 맥락화를 저해했으며, 여전히 인문학자들은 디지털기술과의 직접적인 결합의 주체가 되지 못하는 한계를 가져왔다.
   그런 점에서 한국의 상황에서 시급한 정책과제는 인문학자를 대상으로 한 디지털인문학 교육프로그램이라고 할 수 있다. 디지털인문학은
   인문학자가 중심이 되어 디지털기술을 활용한 다양한 연구성과를산출할 때에 완성될 수 있을 것이다. 아울러 앞으로 한국도
   세계디지털인문학을주관하는 ADHO의 산하단체로 가입하여 활동할 필요가 있다는 점을 강조하였다.

AB Two major research resources for humanities scholars are manuscripts and
   scholarly editions (rigorously reconstituted standard texts of seminal
   writers and thinkers). However, most of these resources either have not
   been digitized or are not easy to access online [1]. Consequently,
   scholars frequently need to spend unnecessary time and effort to find
   and manage different versions of materials (physical or digital) from
   different sources. To solve this problem, we propose an online platform
   called CORPUS - a Collaborative Online Research Platform for Users of
   Scholarly edition - to support scholarly research online in an efficient
   manner. CORPUS aims to integrate different types of research materials
   in the humanities (manuscripts, scholarly editions, online publications,
   and personal notes) and aggregate different versions of the same texts.
   In addition, it enhances collaboration among scholars while also
   providing them with a peer-review-based incentive to share and publish
   their research work.

AB While recent years have seen the availability of some truly
   innovativedigital resources in the international field of literary
   studies, there is yetlittle sustained investigation, reflection or
   critique by humanities scholarsof the new forms of knowledge thus
   generated, or of the new scales andtypes of research made possible, or
   of the new kinds of intellectual brokeragewhich may be necessary to link
   digital and analogue resources.The current debate concerning distant and
   close reading offers an opportunityto advance this necessary wider
   analysis. The chosen case study isthe recently completed online resource
   Guide to Irish Fiction: 1650-1900, accessible at http://www.lgif.ie (PI
   Margaret Kelleher), an electronicversion of the Loebers’ Guide to Irish
   Fiction, a bibliography ofsome 5,000 titles. This project provides a
   concrete example of the challengesand opportunities presented by distant
   reading, and relatedly bynew developments in digital humanities, to the
   field of eighteenth andnineteenth-century Irish fiction and to the
   established canon of Irish fiction.The paper situates this project in
   the context of current debates onthe research significance of
   macroanalyses and distant readings, withspecific reference to the
   potential gains for previously neglected domainsof national literatures.

AB This paper aims to survey the current research trends of digital
   humanities in the UnitedStates in order to lay the groundwork for the
   development of digital humanities in Korea. Inparticular, this survey is
   mainly focused on the various projects supported by the Office ofDigital
   Humanities (ODH) of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).The
   grant programs offered by the NEH include the Digital Humanities
   Start-UpGrants, which support the initial stages of planning digital
   humanities researches, as well asthe Digital Humanities Implementation
   Grants, which are involved with the actual implementation of research
   projects. Also, the Institute for Advanced Topics in theDigital
   Humanities is designed to support training programs for humanities
   scholars toenhance their understanding on digital humanities
   methodologies. The Digging Into Data Challenge seeks for a new research
   method to use big data that has been established through diverse
   digitalization projects, and the NEH/DFG Bilateral Digital
   HumanitiesProgram displays exemplary international cooperation models
   for humanities research.The most fundamental implications of the NEH’s
   Digital Humanities Project are asfollows: First, the main actors of the
   researches should be humanities scholars whose academic bases are on the
   traditional humanities disciplines. Second, a certain kind of training
   programs are required to transform these scholars into “digital
   humanities scholars,” since they are not familiar with the methodology
   related to information &communication technologies. For this reason, the
   development and operation of such training programs are recognized as
   important projects and properly supported during the initial phases for
   promoting digital humanities.In Korea, along with digital humanities,
   “cultural content” studies have been emerged as a result of
   methodological convergence between humanities and information
   &communication technologies. Cultural content studies in Korea succeeded
   in achieving positive outcomes in terms of industrial application of
   humanities studies. However, unlike the United States, this approaches
   turned out to be insufficient for providing solid foundation for
   humanities studies and innovating relevant research methodologies. It is
   expected that Korean humanities researchers will discover a mutual,
   complementary progress both for the traditional humanities disciplines
   and the applied humanities contributing to creative industries through a
   comprehensive understanding and analysis on the current research trends
   of digital humanities of the world.
AK 이 글은 미국 디지털인문학의 실상에 대한 이해를 높이고, 향후 우리나라의 디지털인문학 육성 시책 개발에 참고가 되게 하려는
   목적에서, 미국 인문학재단이 디지털인문학 진흥을 위하여 수행하고 있는 지원 프로그램 및 이를 통해 수행되고 있는디지털인문학 연구
   프로젝트의 실제 내용을 조사, 분석, 정리한 것이다.미국 인문학재단(NEH)의 디지털인문학단(ODH, Office of
   DigitalHumanities)에서 지원하는 디지털인문학 프로젝트의 유형은 5가지이다. 그 첫번째인 ‘디지털인문학 초기 조성
   지원금’(Digital Humanities Start-UpGrants)은 디지털인문학의 경험이 없는 순수 인문학자들이 디지털
   기술을 활용하여 새로운 연구를 시도할 수 있도록 하는 지원금이다. 본격적으로 디지털인문학연구의 수행이 가능해지면, ‘디지털인문학
   실행 지원금’(Digital HumanitiesImplementation Grants)을 통해서 실제적인 프로젝트를 수행하도록
   하고 있다.또한 ‘디지털인문학 전문가 양성 프로그램 지원금’(Institute for AdvancedTopics in the
   Digital Humanities)을 통해서 전통 인문학자들을 대상으로 디지털인문학 방법론을 교육하고 전파할 수 있도록 지원하고
   있다. ‘인문학 빅데이터분석 과제’(Digging Into Data Challenge)는 다양한 분야에서 축적된 빅데이터를
   인문학적으로 활용하는 방안을 모색 하고 있으며, 독일의 연구진흥협회(DFG)와 공동으로 미․독 양국의 협력 연구팀을 선발․지원하는
   ‘NEH/DFG 디지털인문학 협력 프로그램’(NEH/DFG Bilateral Digital Humanities
   Program)은디지털인문학 분야에서의 국제 협력 모델을 제시하고 있다.현재까지 NEH의 지원을 받아 수행되는 디지털인문학
   프로젝트는 전통적인 인문학에서 다루어 오던 연구 주제를 디지털 시대에 디지털 기술의 도움을 받아 수행함으로써 새로운 성과를
   도출하려는 시도가 주류를 이룬다. 중요한 시사점은 이러한 프로젝트 기획 및 수행의 전 과정이 인문학 연구자들의 주도로 이루어지며,
   디지털 기술의 이해와 운용 또한 인문학자들 스스로 담당해야 할 과제로 인식하고 있다는 점이다. 또한 개인 연구보다는 공동 연구를
   지향하며, 디지털 기술을 바탕으로연구 소통을 강조하여 연구 과정에서의 학제 간 공동연구 방법이나 연구 결과의 완전 공개를 강력하게
   요구하고 있는 것도 NEH 디지털인문학 육성 프로그램에서 의미 있게 짚어보아야 할 사항들이다.

   considered as the future of humanities, especially inthe recent
   situation where the “crisis of humanities” prevails all over the world.
   In Korea,the alternative to pass through the humanities crisis was
   presented under the title of“cultural contents,” producing a large
   number of significant achievements in terms ofcommercializing the
   research results. However, these achievements are expected to befurther
   improved and expanded by incorporating diverse efforts made in digital
   humanities,which focuses on the development of new methodologies for
   humanities studies. Thepurpose of this paper is to provide an overview
   of the national policies for and currentresearch trend of digital
   humanities, in particular in the United States, Taiwan, Japan, andChina,
   so as to establish a solid foundation for development and dissemination
   of digitalhumanities in Korea.In the United States, as the academic
   circles continuously tried to develop the concept ofdigital humanities
   with the positive support from the national government, the scope
   ofdigital humanities projects has been expanded towards data mining,
   data analysis, and newdigital forms of education. The Taiwanese
   government provides substantial support throughvarious national policies
   for developing digital humanities, and the country, as a result,
   hasemerged as the leader of digital humanities in Asia. Although only
   receiving minimalgovernmental support, the Japanese academia adopts the
   US and European digitalhumanities methodologies to integrate them into
   their own ways. Digital humanitiesresearches in China concentrate on
   digitalizing sources, and thus are still in the rather earlystages.

   Three types of fusion transcending the frameworks of literary studies
   and other academic fields may be considered; (1) cultural memory
   studies, (2) translation studies, and (3) digital humanities.
   Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that an understanding of

   studies) will be useful to encourage academic fusion based on the
   sharing of ideas and concepts between scholars from different

AB Argumentation is an essential task in every scientific discipline. The
   development of strong and convincing argumentation as well as the
   analysis of existing argumentation structures is important in the field
   of humanities, and especially in the field of jurisprudence. Judicial
   argumentation requires sophisticated intellectual effort and the
   knowledge of as much potentially relevant background information as
   possible. Considering that the fulfillment of this task is limited by
   the natural human information processing capacity, the field of digital
   humanities investigates how such information-intensive and
   time-consuming tasks can be supported by computers. Against the
   background of the ever-growing availability of different corpora of
   jurisdiction in Germany, a software prototype supporting automated
   identification, analysis and recommendation of argumentation structures
   in electronically available corpora of jurisdiction is currently
   developed in the project ARGUMENTUM. In this article, we present the
   basic concept for the preparation and processing of the decision corpus
   of the German Federal Constitutional Court which shall provide the basis

AB There are five points tackled with in this article.First, the new social
   phenomena called the digital revolution, and the emergence of
   theCultural Contents, are examined as a ‘social change
   motivator.’Second, the foundation of the ‘Humanities Contents Society’
   is chronicled.Third, the concept of ‘contents’ is discussed in
   comprehensive terms.Fourth, the overall relationship between Humanities
   studies and the Department ofCultural Contents is examined here as well.
   The primary argument of this article is that theexisting Humanities
   Departments should add contents classes to their curricula, or
   affiliatecurricula with other Cultural content programs. And in the
   meantime, the existingDepartment of Cultural Contents, which mostly
   began as Humanities ContentsDepartments, should endeavor to include 
   convergence and comprehensiveness in theircurricula.Fifth, the direction
   of education that should be taken by Cultural Contents Departmentsare
   presented. 4 directions can be discussed. Reexamination of the
   Humanities/Informationstudies, Humanities studies aiming backward,
   cooperation with professional planners, andemphasis put upon cohesion
   and convergence.And finally, the values behind Cultural Contents should
   be learned. Public consensus andcommunicative methods should be
   acquired.
AK 본 글은 인문콘텐츠학회 10주년을 맞이하여 몇 가지 쟁점을 시대변화와 결부하여 제시하여 본 것이다. 먼저 디지털혁명이라는
   시대변화와 문화콘텐츠의 등장을 필자 나름대로 해석해 보았다. 그리고 인문학의 위기라는 담론에서 문화콘텐츠에 주목한 과정을
   제시하였다. 둘째, 인문콘텐츠학회의 성립과정을 기술해 보았다.이것은 학회 10주년의 기록이라는 의미도 갖고 있으므로, 實名과 함께
   당시 사정을서술하였다. 셋째, 콘텐츠, 문화콘텐츠, CT, 인문콘텐츠의 개념을 검토해 보았다.용어는 현상으로 붙인다는 관점에서
   콘텐츠를 내용물, 문화콘텐츠를 문화적 내용물로 일단 이해한 후에 좀더 의미를 부여하여 이해한다고 해도 전혀 문제될 것이없음을
   밝혔다. 넷째, 인문학 전반과 문화콘텐츠학과의 관련성을 제시해 보았다.아마도 이 부분은 가장 논란이 있을 것으로 판단된다. 필자의
   주된 요지는 기존인문학 계열의 학과들은 필요한 경우 콘텐츠 교과목을 보완하던가 문화콘텐츠 연계전공을 병행한다면 전부
   범(凡)문화콘텐츠학과화(化)된다는 점을 지적하였다. 반면 기존의 문화콘텐츠학과는 전부 인문콘텐츠학과로 시작하였지만, 원칙적으로
   융합과 종합을 목표로 하는 학과를 지향해야 한다는 점을 밝혔다. 다섯째, 문화콘텐츠학과의 교육방향을 4가지 제시해 보았다.
   인문정보학에 대한 재검토, 역(逆)추적의 인문학 시도, 전문기획자와의 협업, 융합 시도의 강조 등이 그것이다.끝으로 문화콘텐츠의
   덕목을 공론(公論)에 입각한 열린 사고와 쌍방향적 인식을 체득할 필요가 있다는 점을 지적하였다. 그리고 이 점은 교육에도
   적용되어야 함을 강조하였다.

AB The aim of this paper is to present results of the research among
   students at the Faculty of humanities and social sciences in Zagreb
   (FHSS) on two important topics: students' use of digital information
   resources and preservation of these digital information resources. To
   find out more about these two topics, a research study was designed. The
   results confirmed that digital information resources are very popular
   among students for use in their education. The results also indicated
   the need of students to have constant access to digital information
   resources and to be able to store a selection of resources on their
   computers. The results also showed that students want digital
   information resources used in education to be available indefinitely and
   that their teachers should be responsible for care for digital
   information resources used in education, which is rather peculiar.
   Students think that digital information resources still cannot replace
   printed information resources. The results indicate lack of information
   about students' needs and attitudes about access and use of digital
   information resources in education for the purpose of development of
   university policies on organization and preservation of digital
   information resources for use in higher education.

AB The aim of this project is to provide a wide collection of useful text
   processing tools as online services. This includes tools related to XML
   documents, DTDs, Schemas, XSLT processing, HTML, etc.
   Most of these tools are already available, but to be useful, they have
   to be downloaded and properly installed on the user's machine. The idea
   of having them adapted and installed as form-based web services, allows
   for anyone to use them from anywhere, at any time, without the need of
   installation. This is particularly useful for teaching Digital
   Humanities (DH) hands-on courses, where one of the main problems is to
   get all the necessary tools installed before the course takes place.
   This set of online services will also suffice for emerging or small
   digitization projects, and as a display and workbench for DH scholars
   looking for tools.

AB The current article provides an overview of the new science of Digital
   Humanities, in Britain and the U.S. in the mid-twentieth century. Its
   main feature is the consolidation of scientific and digital culture, in
   order to optimize the research process in the field of Humanities. New
   technologies are used, in this case, to store and analyze the cultural
   database. A quick call to the history of cultural studies ascertains the
   naturalness of the process, since the (new) media is used in each era to
   describe the present, and assess the past. However, despite its
   venerable age, and the fact that it has become widespread over all the
   continents, Digital Humanities to this day, defends its right to
   autonomy. The article's authors raise questions about the scientific and
   disciplinary status of Digital Humanities, about scientists' limits of
   competence / professors of a new type, who use digital technology to
   analyze cultural phenomena. Of course, there are no simple answers, due
   to the formation of the science. The authors focus their attention on
   the history and development of the Digital Humanities, its scientific
   and educational institutionalization, and the evolution of its subject
   of analysis.      
Z4 Статья посвящена обзору новой науки Digital Humanities, которая
   возникает в Британии и США в середине ХХ века. Её главной особенностью
   является консолидация научной и цифровой культур, с целью оптимизации
   исследовательского процесса в сфере гуманитарных наук. Новые технологии
   используются в данном случае для хранения и анализа культурной базы
   данных. При беглом обращении к истории исследований культуры
   констатируется естественность данного процесса, поскольку (новые) медиа
   использовались каждой эпохой для описания современности и
   диагностирования предшествующего. Но несмотря на почтенный возраст и
   распространение по всем континентам, Digital Humanities до сего дня
   отстаивает свое право на автономность. Собственно, авторами статьи
   поднимаются вопросы о научном и дисциплинарном статусе Digital
   Humanities, о границах компетенции ученого/преподавателя нового типа,
   использующего цифровые технологии для анализа культурных феноменов.
   Разумеется, однозначные ответы не могут быть даны вследствие становления
   данной науки. Авторы сосредотачивают свое внимание на истории
   возникновения и развития Digital Humanities, её научной и педагогической
   институализации, эволюции предмета анализа.

AB It is often found on the discourses of convergent education to consider
   that arts and humanities are creative resources for technological
   progress. While such an idea can remind us the importance of art and
   humanities, it has a limitation in aspect of dualism between humanities
   and technologies. The discipline of digital contents is regarded as a
   discipline to work towards convergence of arts, humanities and
   technologies. However, the academic and theoretical foundation is weak
   because the organization of discipline is led by governmental policies
   to prompt a new industry in Korea.This paper examines the media
   education of the State University of New York at Buffalo and reviews
   discourses on digital humanities to discuss problems of applying digital
   technology to arts and humanities research. This study suggests that
   software studies, platform studies and critical code studies can be
   theoretical foundations of digital contents discipline and provides an
   alternative to the organization of convergent discipline and pedagogy.
AK 융합교육에 관한 담론에서 일반적으로 발견되는 태도는 인문학과 예술이 기술에 상상력을 제공해준다는 보는 것이다. 이러한 태도는
   인문학의 중요성을 환기하는 계기가 됨에도 불구하고 한편으로 인문학과 기술을 분리하는 관점을 견지한다는 측면에서 한계를 갖는다.
   국내의 디지털콘텐츠 학제는 인문학, 예술과 디지털 기술의 융합을 지향하는 학제로 인식되면서도 학제 편성이 정부 주도의 산업 모델에
   기반하고 있기 때문에 학술적, 이론적 기반이 취약하다.본 논문은 매체이론을 중심으로 융합교육을 실천한 사례로서 뉴욕주립대학교
   버팔로의 미디어 교육을 살펴보고, 디지털 기술을 인문학과 예술의 연구와 교육에 수용하는 문제와 관련된 논의로서 디지털 인문학
   담론들을 고찰한다. 이 연구를 통해 디지털콘텐츠 학제의 이론적 토대로서 소프트웨어 연구, 플랫폼 연구, 비판적 코드 연구의
   가능성을 타진하고 융합학제 편성과 교육론에 하나의 대안을 제시하고자 한다.

AB The Mind Humanities ‘sharing’is defined as a networking line of group
   members who share specific goals. It also means social relationships
   among individuals in the era of web 2.0. In other words, it is
   considered as a study which enables social members to connect or share
   knowledge resources of the Mind Humanities.This research aims to develop
   the Mind Humanities to be a human science presenting a new paradigm of
   spiritual civilization of mankind through studying issues and prospect
   of the Mind Humanities sharing.First, this study will draw a core value
   of the Mind Humanities by combining their theory and practice in
   building contents of the Mind Humanities.Second, it focuses on producing
   and adapting electronic cultural atlas of the Mind Humanities, which is
   thought to find out the change and awareness of a new paradigm of the
   Mind Humanities sharing and explore a practical alternative model of
   endangered humanities.Third, it centers on the development and
   distribution of electronic cultural atlas of the Mind Humanities, which
   can enhance the quality of daily life beyond time and space.The
   ‘sharing’department of the Mind Humanities will try to make built
   digital knowledge resources be unique products which are produced
   circulated and consumed, and bear their unique identity different from
   other digital knowledge resources.
AK 마음인문학에서의 공유(共有, sharing)의 의미는 웹2.0 시대에 개인과개인 사이의 사회적 관계를 뜻하는 것으로, 특정 관계를
   가지고 있는 사람들 간에 존재하는 연결선을 말한다. 즉 마음인문학의 지식자원을 사람들 간에 연결할 수 있도록 하는 매체를 연구하고
   실현하는 연구이다.본 연구에서는 마음인문학 공유분과의 과제와 전망을 통해 마음인문학이 인류 정신문명의 새로운 패러다임을 전개하는
   학문으로 성장 발전하고 개인뿐만 아니라 세계인들이 마음인문학의 심층적 연구 성과를공유하고 활용할 수 있도록 하는데 있다. 즉,
   새로운 조화의 정신문명을 창출하기 위해 마음인문학의 공유분과에서 10년 동안 어떻게 연구할 것인지를 단계적으로 제시하고자
   한다.첫째로는 마음인문학 콘텐츠 기반 구축이다. 마음인문학 콘텐츠 자료의 기반 구축으로 이론과 실천의 균형 있는 결합을 통해
   마음인문학콘텐츠 개발의 핵심적 가치를 이끌 것이다.둘째로는 마음인문학 전자문화지도의 제작 및 적용이다. 새로운 공유
   패러다임으로서의 마음인문학, 나아가 마음인문학의 그 변화와 인식 속에서 어떻게 자리매김할 수 있을지, 그리고 궁극적으로는
   우리의시도가 위기에 빠진 인문학의 실용적 대안 모델 가운데 하나가 될 수 있는지를 모색하기 위하여 연구를 진행할 것이다.셋째로는
   마음인문학 전자문화지도 확충 및 유통이다. 마음인문학전자문화지도를 전문분류체계에 따라 구축해 시간과 공간을 뛰어넘어살아 숨 쉬는
   정보이자 생활문화로 만들어 가는 것이다.이를 위해 공유분과에서는 마음인문학 디지털 지식자원 구축을 활성화하고 더 나아가 상품으로써
   생산, 유통 및 소비될 수 있도록 마음인문학 디지털 지식자원이 다른 디지털 지식자원과 차별되는 정체성을 지니도록 하여야 한다.

AB This study is to analyze the general cause of the crisis of humanities
   in Korea and suggest the introduction of ‘Digital Humanitas’ which
   encourages and improves the ability of ‘consilience’ by using digital
   tools in the various fields of conventional humanities. To carry out the
   study, a method of approaching ‘digital humanities’ is shown through
   ‘S(Search)-C(Connect)- S(Share)’ reading strategy of Shakespeare’s
   Hamlet.Since the widespread use of internet browser and digital media,
   the world has seen some significant change in the way people read,
   write, learn and communicate. And the value of the humanities which
   pursues the mental meaning and value of human life and existence has
   been underestimated, and many people even ignore the necessity of the
   humanities. It is natural for us to face the crisis of humanities in our
   society. This isn't a fad or a trend but a permanent change in our
   society that needs to be addressedand needs to be addressed by
   humanists.Digital age requires a new method and perspective to be
   understood its culture. This is why ‘digital humanitas’ is strongly
   requested to us as time goes by and as IT is developed day by day.
   However, as it is shown in the study of the examples of digital
   humanities in Korea and in the United states, they are all focused on
   the training of using digital tools to improve students’ information
   literacy. They cannot connect digital technology with the humanities in
   the real meaning. Digital humanitas, as a concept, should include the
   ability of consilience of the humanities as well as the usage of digital
   tools.As a method of connecting digital skills with the humanities, this
   study shows a reading strategy of ‘S(Search)-C(Connect)-S(Share)’ and
   applies the strategy to reading Hamlet. The result suggests that the
   humanist should positively accept and include digital skills, and help
   students improve their abilities of consilience which unites different
   areas and produces some creative ideas.

AB This study examined concepts about humanities knowledge resources, forms
   of digital resources, and features of humanities contents which is being
   applied based on the concepts. Particularly, the study analyzed
   humanities information which is digitized in the scholarly and
   industrial domains and suggested considerations for planning to utilize
   digital humanities contents. It is necessary to develop contents that
   clearly define users and that utilize features of digital resources.
   Moreover, there is a need to build humanities contents of a distributing
   system, and to provide various access points for research, to develop
   and apply standard format to enhance reciprocal operation.
AK 본 연구는 인문지식정보원에 대한 개념과 현재 이를 근간으로 응용되고 있는 인문콘텐츠 분야의 특성과 디지털 자원의 형식을 고찰해
   보았다. 특히 학술적인 영역과 산업적인 영역의 디지털화된 인문콘텐츠정보를 분석하여 향후 디지털 인문콘텐츠 활용을 위한 설계
   고려점을 제시해 보았다. 디지털 자원의 특성을 살리되 이용대상을 명확히 하는 콘텐츠 개발이 필요하며, 분산체제형의 인문콘텐츠
   구축이 필요하지만 상호 운영성 향상을 위한 표준 포맷 개발과 적용이 시급하다. 또한 다양한 정보검색을 위한 접근점을 제공해야 함을
   지적하였다.

AB The main paradigm of the media is shifting from writing to digital codes
   and images. With the advent of postmodernism, the death of author and
   book is being declared. The humanities are the consequences of the
   literate culture. The paradigm of the culture, however, is changing. Are
   the digital codes and images the alternative of the humanities? We argue
   that the blind following of the new media will deepen the crisis of the
   humanities since the nihilism implied by the new media leads the
   humanities to death bed. We will try to find a way out in the “untimely
   meditations” on the new media. The reason why the current humanities are
   dying is because of the two reasons. On the one hand, they did not
   respond properly to the one dimensional project of formatting the rich
   matters about humans and their lives in a single way. On the other hand,
   they failed to locate the meaning of those matters in the matters
   themselves.
AK 매체의 주된 패러다임이 문자에서 디지털 코드와 영상으로 바뀌고 있다. 포스트모더니즘이라는 시류를 타고 책과 저자의 죽음이
   선포되고, 영상 관련 산업의 붐과 맞물려 영상정보가 뜨고 있다. 인문학은 그 이름에 새겨져 있듯이 문자문화의 산물이다. 그런데 그
   문화의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있는 것이다. 그렇다면 디지털과 영상정보가 인문학의 새로운 나아갈 길인가? 이 글에서 우리는 시류에
   편승한 뉴미디어의 추종이 오히려 인문학의 위기를 더욱 심화시킬 것으로 진단한다. 뉴미디어가 함축하는 허무주의가 인문학의 사망을
   선고하고 있기 때문이다. 이를 적시하는 반시대적 비판과 성찰에서 우리는 인문학의 갈 길을 찾고자 한다. 작금의 인문학이 고사위기에
   처한 까닭은 가까이는 인문학의 주제인 인간과 그의 삶이라는 풍성한 사태성을 단 하나의 방식으로 포맷하는 이 시대의 일차원적 기획에
   적절히 대처해지 못했기 때문이며, 멀리는 그 풍성한 사태성의 의미를 그 사태성 자체에 자리매김하는데 실패했기 때문이다.

   based on the Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA), which supports
   flexibly constructing and deploying various digital media applications.
   The system shield the heterogeneity of resources via data access service
   so that the enormous dispersed resources can be effectively accessed and
   integrated. We also propose an on-demand application constructing method
   based on service composition. Using this method, we can implement
   digital media applications by dynamic service binding. Moreover, we
   implement digital media service applications based on this platform,
   such as 3D virtual museum walkthrough system.

AB Nowadays identity of university rapidly shifts from ivory tower which
   seeking after truth to training center of high-grade human resources
   which market needs. University crisis is unavoidable in post-industrial
   society. Humanities crisis might be understood extension of that.
   Transformation of humanity to cultural content study in a sense
   inevitable. But I doubt humanities can bring cultural content
   specialists which market needs by extending research domain to new
   media.This article aims to reveal roles of humanities in training
   cultural content specialist and direction of humanities research for
   creating cultural content standing on my experiences of teaching KAIST
   Graduate School of Cultural Technology students. Humanities already have
   trained cultural content specialists such as novelists, screenplay
   writers before the concept of cultural content has established. In the
   age of analogue cultual content specialists just needed depth, but in
   the age of digital they need width as well as depth. For educating
   cultual content specialists humanities have to teach deep knowledge of
   humanities instead of extending research domain to new media. Humanities
   have to demolish inner barriers and return to original text.
AK 오늘날 지식 창출과 진리 탐구의 상아탑으로서 대학의 위상은 급속히 시장이 필요로 하는 고급인력 양성소로 변화되고 있다.
   후기산업사회에서 대학제도의 위기는 필연적이다. 인문학의 위기는 그 연장선상에서 이해되어야 한다. 인문학이 문화콘텐츠학으로 변화를
   시도하는 것은 인문학의 위기 극복을 위해 불가피한 측면이 있다. 그러나 인문학의 연구 대상을 새로운 미디어로 확장시키고, 인문학
   전공자에게 다양한 미디어기술을 교육한다고 과연 시장에서 요구하는 문화콘텐츠 전문 인력을 양성할 수 있을지는 의문이다. 이 논문은
   필자가 한국과학기술원 문화기술대학원에 참여한 경험을 바탕으로 문화콘텐츠 전문 인력 양성에 인문학이 어떠한 역할을 담당할 수
   있으며, 문화콘텐츠화를 전제로 한 인문학 연구는 어떠한 방향으로 진행되어야 하는지 밝히는 것을 목표로 한다. 인문학은 문화콘텐츠
   개념이 등장하기 이전에도 소설가나 시나리오 작가 같은 문화콘텐츠 전문 인력을 양성해왔다. 아날로그 시대 문화콘텐츠 전문 인력이
   특정 분야의 전문성을 요구받았다면, 디지털 시대의 전문 인력은 폭넓은 분야의 깊이 있는 지식을 요구받는다. 문화콘텐츠 전문 인력을
   양성하기 위해서 인문학은 다른 분야로 영역을 확대시키는 것보다 인문학 교육 자체에 충실할 필요가 있다. 문화콘텐츠 산업이 필요로
   하는 인문학적 지식은 인문학의 개별 학문 분야의 경계에 존재한다. 문화콘텐츠 전문 인력 양성을 위해 인문학은 내부의 장벽부터
   제거해야 하고, 해석 중심의 인문학에서 지식 생산 중심의 인문학으로 변화해야 하며, 무엇보다도 원전 교육에 충실해야 한다.

AB Much recent research in database design focuses on persistence models
   for semistructured data similar to the SGML and XML that humanities
   digital libraries have long used to encode digital editions of texts.
   Structure-aware querying promises to simplify the design of such digital
   repositories by allowing them to store and query texts using a single,
   unified information model. Using content the Perseus Project has
   acquired over the past ten years as a test case, we describe the
   advantages and delimit the problems in managing structure-aware queries
   over multiple or ambiguous schemas, evaluate the place of markup in
   digital libraries where much content is automatically generated, and
   examine the uses for structure-aware query in a system that stores both
   semistructured content and graph-structured metadata.
